They called ostrich. “We all know that you have the longest and strongest legs of all of us,” they said.

But Lion said, “I don't hear ostrich's sweet singing voice anymore.” He turned and saw ostrich running away into the veld."},{"15":"After a long, long time, Lion came back. He was very, very tired. He was very, very angry. He did not have his fire sticks. Ostrich was too fast for him."},{"16":"Then Lion spoke to all the people and all the animals. “From this day on,” he said, “you must all be very, very careful. I will hunt you, and chase you, and when I catch you I will eat you.”"},{"17":"And so this is how people came to have fire.

I've walked so far today, and I'm so tired and hungry.” So what could Anansi do but let him in?"},{"04":"Anansi was too selfish to share his beautiful delicious yams with anybody else.

So he slowly crawled to the river, washed his hands, and then crawled back."},{"05":"But meanwhile Anansi had started gobbling up the yams. By the time Turtle got back, he saw that the yams were all gone. Turtle looked at Anansi. “Thank you for inviting me to dinner. If you're ever near my house, please come by and let me return the favour,” said Turtle. And Turtle began crawling slowly away to his house."},{"06":"As time went by, Anansi began to think more and more about how Turtle had promised to feed him a free dinner. So one day he walked over to Turtle's house. Anansi got to Turtle's house just about dinnertime, as the sun was going down over the river. Turtle was lying on a rock in the sun, warming himself up, as turtles do. When Turtle saw Anansi, he said, “Hello there, Anansi, have you come to have dinner with me?” And Anansi said, “Yes, that would be very nice, thank you.” He was getting hungrier and hungrier."},{"07":"So Turtle dived down to the bottom of the river to set the table for dinner and get everything ready. Anansi waited on the rocks by the shore. Soon Turtle swam back up and said, “Oh Anansi, it is all ready now, please join me for dinner.” And Turtle dived down again and began to eat the green leaves he had for dinner."},{"08":"Anansi tried to dive down to the bottom of the river, but he was a spider, not a turtle, and he couldn't dive that deep. He kept floating back up to the surface again. He tried jumping in, he tried diving in, but nothing helped. He just couldn't get down to that dinner."},{"09":"Finally Anansi had an idea. He put lots of stones in the pockets of his coat, and finally he was heavy enough to sink down to the bottom of the river. How clever he was! He saw Turtle's table, full of juicy green leaves and lots of other delicious food. Anansi's mouth was watering."},{"10":"But just as Anansi was reaching for some of that delicious food, Turtle stopped him. “Anansi, surely you're not going to eat dinner with your coat on? That's not how we do things at my house.” Anansi, without thinking, said, “Oh, of course you're right, Turtle, what was I thinking?” He took off his coat."},{"11":"But without the rocks in his pockets to hold him down, Anansi floated right back to the surface of the river again, and popped out of the water.

Lion caught up with him and returned to the fire with his sticks."},{"12":"Again, Lion sang his boastful song. “To me it does not matter. I don't have a problem. I can eat you with hair, I can eat you without hair. I don't have a problem. All of you are food to me.”"},{"13":"“Oh,” sighed the people, “Which animal can help us now? Ostrich has the longest legs of all, let us ask him.” They explained the plan to Ostrich and he grabbed Lion's fire sticks this time."},{"14":"Lion said, “Why do I not hear Ostrich's high singing voice behind me anymore?” He looked around, saw Ostrich and chased after him."},{"15":"After a long time, Lion returned with a tired face, for Ostrich ran too fast for him. “From this day on,” he said, “I will not leave any of you alone.

I stopped crying and looked around to see if anyone would buy the children in the room.

I ran away from him."},{"14":"When my mother and aunt heard my name, they rushed to the room. “Etabo, Etabo!” a familiar voice called.

They chose Baboon to keep an eye on things. Baboon was at the well when Hare came at night saying, “Tipite!

And you are not able to climb a tree,” Hare explained."},{"06":"Hyena was convinced by Hare's words. He agreed to till the land alone. It was a lot of work. Hare did not help at all. After tilling the land, Hyena planted maize in the whole field, alone."},{"07":"When weeds grew in the field, Hyena used a hoe to weed. It was a lot of work.

He thought his stories were quite safe."},{"05":"So Anansi climbed slowly back down his sticky thread to the earth. He thought and he thought, and he came up with a plan. He dug a deep hole, covered it with branches and dirt so it was hidden, and he went home for supper. In the morning, sure enough, a leopard had fallen into his pit. He was furiously scratching at the side of the pit, but he couldn't get out."},{"06":"\"Oh let me help you, my dear friend!\" said Anansi. \"Just lie down on these sticks and I'll pull you out.\" Anansi wound his sticky web round the leopard and the sticks, and pulled him up to heaven to show the Sky God. But Nyame just laughed and said, \"Where are the other two?\""},{"07":"So Anansi went back down to earth to get the second creature. He thought and he thought and he came up with a plan. He took a gourd full of water and went to the tree where the hornets lived. He poured out some of the water all over their nest. Then he cut a leaf from a banana tree and held it over his head, and he poured the rest of the water all over himself."},{"08":"He called out to the hornets, \"Hey hornets! Come see! It is raining! Quick - get inside my gourd and it will keep all of you dry.\" Hornets don't like to get wet, so they all flew into Anansi's gourd."},{"09":"Then Anansi quickly spun a web across the opening so the hornets couldn't get out no matter how much they buzzed.

He thought and thought and he thought, but he couldn't come up with a plan. So he asked his wife, who had a very good idea. Together they found a good long thick branch and some strong vines.

Just put your stick next to me and measure!\""},{"12":"So Anansi did that, and he tied the snake to the stick with his vine to keep him straight. When he was all tied up, Anansi took the snake up to heaven."},{"13":"Nyame had to admit that Anansi had paid his price. So he went to his wooden box, opened the lid, and gave all the stories to Anansi. Anansi carried the stories triumphantly down to earth.

Careful not to step on any dry, noisy grass, he walked, crawled and crept all day long until he finally found the eland. It was grazing on a hill."},{"05":"Quietly, Tjenga set his arrow in the bow and pulled until the string was tight and ready. He aimed at the eland's heart. Tjenga released the poison arrow and it flew through the air. The arrow hit the eland's heart."},{"06":"Tjenga was afraid because he had shot the beautiful eland. He lay down silently in the bush, resting and waiting for the poison arrow to do its work. The sky and the air around Tjenga shivered from the midday heat while the hunter waited for the eland to die."},{"07":"Suddenly, the eland turned into a person. Tjenga's heart was even more afraid, for he did not mean to kill a person. What would the people say if they found that he had killed a person? Tjenga walked to his friend Ngu, to tell him what had happened. When he found his friend and told him the news, he said, “I am in big trouble. I hunted an eland and after I shot it, it became a person. Please, you must help me now so that I can bury it before the people see what I have done.” Ngu said, “Oh no! You are not my own family. I cannot make your problem my problem!” With a sore heart, the young hunter returned to his own people. Tjenga told them his story.

They danced all night and celebrated the food that the hunter had brought home. Tjenga's father said to him, “Now you have learnt a great lesson. You cannot leave your own people and adopt another.

Tjenga's elders explain to the young hunter that the beautiful antelope is not a human being, that animals and people are different. As with many San stories, this one hints at the primeval time before humans and animals were separated from each other. It also teaches about the difference between family and friends. The illustrations in this story are from story boards by Marlene Winberg, interpreted digitally by Satsiri Winberg through manipulations of the Manyeka Art Collection of paintings made by San artists /Thaalu Rumao, /Tuoi Samcuia and Joao Wenne Dikuango, who have all passed away since."}]},{"i":"0094","t":"Anansi, the crows, and the crocodiles","a":"b|Ghanaian folktale|Wiehan de Jager","s":[{"02":"One day there was a great famine in the land. No one had anything to eat except the crows. Each morning they flew a long distance to where there was a tree with ripe figs in the middle of a wide river. Then they flew back with the figs for themselves and their relatives. The sight of so many figs made Anansi's mouth water. How could he get them for himself?"},{"03":"He thought of a plan. He carefully covered his bottom with sticky beeswax. Then he took a piece of clay pot and went to see the crows. “Please could you help me?” he asked. “I need a live coal to get my fire going again.” As they were getting the coal from the fire, Anansi carefully sat firmly on one of the largest figs, so that it would stick to his bottom. He thanked the crows, and hurried home to enjoy the fig."},{"04":"But one fig wasn't enough for him. He went back a second time, and did the same. When he went back a third time, the crows began to get suspicious. “Why do you keep coming back to us to get a coal?” they said. Anansi answered, “Every time when I get home, the coal has burnt out.” “You're lying!” said the crows. “You just want our food!” “That's not true,” said Anansi. And he started crying."},{"05":"The crows felt sorry for him. The next morning at first light, each crow gave him a feather. He flew with them to the fig tree in the middle of the wide river. When he saw the luscious figs, Anansi wanted them all for himself. Each time a crow tried to pick a fig, he shouted out, “That one is mine! I saw it first!” And then he took the fig and put it into his bag. Eventually he had all the figs and the crows had none."},{"06":"He was left all alone as the darkness began to fall. “If I don't want to stay in this tree for the rest of my life,” he said to himself, “I'll just have to jump into the air like the crows”. So he took a deep breath, jumped, and…PLOP! He fell into the river right among the crocodiles."},{"07":"“What do we have here?” said a gruff crocodile voice. “A tasty morsel to eat, nyum…” “Oh please don't,” said Anansi. And he began to cry. “I'm one of you, don't you know? I got lost in the days of your grandfathers and no one was able to find me. You're the first of my relatives I've ever met!” He cried so much that the crocodiles felt sorry for him."},{"08":"The oldest crocodile said, “We'll know you're one of us if you can eat and enjoy mud soup just like we do.” They gave him a pot of dirty brown water. “Just like my grandmother used to make it!” Anansi said. But he made a hole in the ground with his back foot, and a hole in the pot with his front foot. As he pretended to drink the soup, it oozed down through the pot into the hole beneath his feet."},{"09":"“Delicious!” he exclaimed, giving back the empty pot. “Now we know you are definitely one of us,” the crocodiles said. So they allowed Anansi to sleep in their hole with them for the night. “Tomorrow morning I'll tell you the story of my life,” said Anansi as they fell asleep."},{"10":"Early the next morning, before first light, Anansi woke up one of the crocodiles. “I want to go and fetch my wife and children from across the river, so that they can help me tell my story. Will you help me before the others wake up?” he asked the crocodile."},{"11":"The crocodile was grumpy at being woken up so early. “Please help me! You swim much faster than I do,” Anansi said. The crocodile agreed, and Anansi rode on his back to the bank of the river. He climbed off quickly. “I'll be back soon! Don't go away!” Anansi said, as he disappeared through the grass."},{"12":"As far as we know, the crocodile is waiting for him still, with just his long snout and his beady eyes above the surface of the river."}]},{"i":"0124","t":"A Fish and a Gift","a":"b|Liesl Jobson|Jesse Breytenbach","s":[{"02":"One special Friday Yusuf's father gets dressed before a flicker of light brightens the sky.

Everyone except Sizwe, who woke up with a smile every morning. “Yoh! Sizwe! That smile is magic!” said Gogo. “Is it for me?” Sizwe clapped his hand over his mouth. “But it's MY smile, Gogo,” he whispered."},{"03":"His mother laughed. “Sizwe! A smile is something you can give away without losing it. Look!” She lifted him up to the mirror. There was his smile, just as bright as before."},{"04":"It was time to go out. Mama buttoned up Sizwe's raincoat, and off they went, through the rain, to the library. Down the street, Sizwe's best friend Zanele stood at the window of her house, looking sadly at the rain. Sizwe felt his smile creeping, creeping up. Before he knew it, his smile LEAPT out, and flew across the garden to Zanele."},{"05":"Zanele held on tightly to the smile – it was far too precious to let it get away. As Sizwe walked away to the library, Zanele's doorbell rang. It was the postman, with a letter from her favourite cousin. Zanele was so happy, that the smile bounced up, and beamed out at the postman. “Thank you, Mister Postman!” she said."},{"06":"Zanele's smile was the brightest thing the postman had seen all morning. It kept him warm as he trudged off through the rain. He came to a big house. Inside the gate, a dog was spinning around in circles, barking, barking, barking. He was so silly, that the postman couldn't help smiling. The smile bounced through the gate with a glitter of glee."},{"07":"The dog stopped barking. He pricked up his ears and wagged his tail. Then he turned and ran back to the house with the precious, warm smile. A bent old man opened the door. “Oh, no! You can't come inside. You're all wet!” he told the dog. But right away, the smile beamed up at the old man."},{"08":"The old man stood a little straighter. “Eish,” he said, “Who cares if it's raining? Let's go for a walk, boy!” And off they went, splashing in the puddles. There, at the zebra crossing, stood grumpy Mrs Makabela, the traffic cop. She looked cold, and wet, and miserable. The old man knew just what to do. “Morning, Mrs Makabela!” he called, and smiled his biggest, brightest smile. But Mrs Makabela… did not smile back."},{"09":"Standing in the rain for days can make a face sad, sad, sad. But a smile is a magical thing and, by now, the smile was so strong, and so bright, that it was very hard to keep inside. It didn't work right away, but bit by tiny bit, it began to creep out until, at last…!"},{"10":"A great, big smile lit up Mrs Makabela's face! The school bell rang, and children ran to cross the road. Mrs Makabela put up her sign, and smiled, and smiled, at each and every child."},{"11":"The children smiled at their moms and dads, and their gogos and tatas and brothers and sisters. They smiled at the bus driver and the greengrocer, and Mme Makau, who went off to smile at her husband, who smiled at the mayor... The smiles leapt and rolled and beamed and gleamed until EVERYONE was smiling and giggling and laughing out loud in the rain."},{"12":"In the library, everything was quiet except for the sound of the rain. “It's time to go,” said Sizwe's mother, closing her book. “Aw, mom!” said Sizwe, who had run out of smiles."},{"13":"But as they stepped out into the street… WHAT A SIGHT! Everyone in town was there! Everyone! And they were ALL smiling!"},{"14":"The smiles bounced around and beamed at Sizwe. They warmed him, and tickled him, and crept up, up, up from his toes… to the TOP of his head. He was so full of happiness that the smile burst out, brilliant and beaming bright. And something changed. The dark, gloomy, rainy afternoon didn't seem so dark anymore. Could it be…? YES! The clouds parted, and the warm sun shone down on them, with the biggest, brightest, most brilliant smile of all."}]},{"i":"0328","t":"The tree that saved the village of Ombalantu","a":"b|Karen von Wiese,Beryl Salt,Muhdni Grimwood,Barbara Meyerowitz|Julia te Water Naude","s":[{"02":"Thaimi lived in the village of Ombalantu.

Close by a group of strange men were resting. The men had bows and arrows ... and spears! \"Angula,\" Thaimi whispered. \"Those men are raiders.

We must run home and warn the village.\" So very quietly and quickly Thaimi and Angula ran towards their village."},{"05":"Near their village they met their uncle. He was taking his cow to the water.

It was huge and hollow."},{"12":"Thaimi and her father cut an opening in the side of the tree. All the villagers made their way through the opening into the great hollow inside the baobab tree. Some villagers collected the grain and the pots. Others collected the goats, the sheep and the cattle. And the strange thing was that there was room for everyone."},{"13":"The sun went down. The raiders crept up towards the village. It was dark. Inside the great tree the villagers waited. They were cold. They were hungry. And they were afraid.

From morning to evening they looked for food but they found nothing. Nambuya urged her husband to go further into the forest. Mulongo led the way as Nambuya and the two children followed."},{"04":"Suddenly Mulongo saw a beautiful banana plantation. He called his wife and said, “Is that not a banana plantation? I can see bananas and other food crops. I wonder whose it is.” They moved on and soon saw a house in the middle of the plantation. They stopped, looked in all directions, but there was no one around. Because they were hungry and it was nearly night time, they decided to sit and wait for the owner."},{"05":"Suddenly they heard heavy breathing close to the house. They were frightened to see a huge ogre arrive. “Who are you and what do you want?” asked the ogre in a fearful voice. Mulongo in a trembling voice said, “We came looking for food because there is famine in our place.” The ogre gave them food."},{"06":"For several days the ogre allowed Mulongo and his family to eat his crops without asking for anything in return. One morning, however, the ogre said to Nambuya, “I want you to cook your son for me to eat when I come back this evening.” When the ogre had gone Mulongo went into the bush and killed some small animals, which he asked his wife to cook for the ogre. Meanwhile he asked Mukhwana to climb up a leafy mango tree and hide."},{"07":"In the evening the ogre returned and asked, “Have you cooked Mukhwana for me?” Mulongo's wife answered, “Yes.” She gave the ogre the meat and he greedily ate everything. Then he said, “Tomorrow you cook your daughter.”"},{"08":"The following morning Mulongo and his wife did as they had done on the first day. Namono was hidden up the mango tree. When the ogre returned he said, “Did you cook Namono?” Again, Nambuya told the ogre that she had done so."},{"09":"After eating, the ogre instructed Nambuya to cook her husband Mulongo, the next day. Nambuya was perturbed but Mulongo said he would go out again and catch some animals to cook. He did that and after giving the meat to his wife, he also climbed up the mango tree to hide."},{"10":"At dusk the ogre came back. Nambuya gave the meat to the ogre who enjoyed it very much. He told Nambuya, “Tomorrow cook yourself.” When the ogre had left Nambuya called her husband to advise her. Mulongo said, “Go and look for some small animals and cook them for the ogre. When everything is ready, come up the tree where we are.”"},{"11":"The ogre came back in the afternoon and started eating his tasty evening meal of sweet meat. He felt sleepy, went to lie under the mango tree and began snoring. But not so long after, the ogre woke up because he heard noises above him. The ogre looked up to the tree and saw Mulongo and his wife and children."},{"12":"The ogre was very angry. “So you deceived me? Let me come and get you,” he shouted. As the ogre was struggling to climb up the tree, Mulongo quickly thought of a trick and said, “It will be easier for you to reach us if you tie a rope around your neck and we help to pull you up.”"},{"13":"The ogre ran into the house, brought a strong rope and after tying it around his neck he threw the other end of the rope to Mulongo. Mulongo and his wife and children started pulling the ogre up as they twisted the rope. The rope soon tightened around the ogre's neck until he could not breathe and died.

Lion went back to the trap and put his foot inside to show his friend how he was trapped."},{"14":"“Ouch!” Lion roared. Warthog had closed the trap on Lion's foot. “Aha! I got you,” said Warthog. “You will stay in that trap hungry and thirsty again. See if your strong teeth and sharp claws can help you now.”"},{"15":"“Run! Run! Run away!” Warthog's wife shouted to the children at the top of her voice. “Raise your tails when you are running so that your father can see you,” she called. The babies ran as fast as they could through the bushes."},{"16":"“Warthog please help me!” begged Lion again. He was in pain from the sharp jaws of the hunter's trap. “I will do anything for you if you save me.” “No way, liar! I will never believe you again,” said Warthog. “I will also warn other animals not to save you because you are very sly.”"},{"17":"Warthog saw his children running in a row with their mother. Their tails were lifted up for him to see them. He rushed to his family and they all escaped to safety. To this day, Warthogs and their children always run with their tails lifted up to see that everyone is safe."}]},{"i":"0260","t":"The boy who nobody loved","a":"b|Phumy Zikode|Wiehan de Jager","s":[{"02":"Once upon a time, there was a boy who was so ugly that nobody loved him, even his parents. At home, he would sit alone while his family watched television."},{"03":"At school, you would find him sitting alone while other children were playing."},{"04":"When they went to fetch the cattle, you would find him walking behind all the other boys because they didn't want to walk with him."},{"05":"One day he decided to leave, but he didn't know where he would go. He walked until he got to an indigenous forest. He started to get scared but was comforted by the thought that nobody would speak to him because nobody loved him."},{"06":"When he was about to enter the forest, an old, dirty, ugly woman came up to him. She greeted him and asked what he was doing in the scary forest. The boy was shocked to hear someone speaking to him. He told the old woman that he was going anywhere because nobody loved him."},{"07":"The old woman asked if he needed help. He responded quickly and said “Yes”. The old woman said that before she helped him, she wanted him to lick her face until she was clean and beautiful."},{"08":"The boy didn't have any other option but to lick the old woman's face in order to get the help he needed. He started licking the sleep from her eyes, the snot from her nose and the wax from her ears. He licked her face until she was clean and beautiful."},{"09":"The old woman thanked him. She said, “You will find many wonderful things in the forest, but don't take any of these things. Only bring back the root that you find.”"},{"10":"The boy ran, wanting to see all of those things in the forest. But before he could enter the forest, the old woman called him. She said, “Boy! Come back here!” He ran back to her and said, “I'm here”. She asked him if he had heard what she said to him. “I said you will find many wonderful things in the forest, but don't take any of these things. Only bring back the root that you find,” she repeated. The boy nodded and so the old woman allowed him to go into the forest."},{"11":"The boy ran off, but before he could enter the forest, he heard a voice saying, “Boy! Come back here!” He started to be confused about what the old woman wanted. He ran back to her. She said, “I don't think you heard me properly. I said you will find many wonderful things in the forest, but don't take any of these things. Only bring back the root that you find.” The boy nodded and ran back to the forest."},{"12":"Just after he had entered the forest, he heard a voice again saying, “Boy! Come back here!” He tried to ignore the voice but he continued hearing it so he went back to the old woman. The old woman said, “I don't trust you. I don't think you'll do what I ask you to do. I said you will find many wonderful things in the forest, but don't take any of these things. Only bring back the root that you find.” The boy was starting to become annoyed with the repetition. He ran faster than before, until he was in the forest."},{"13":"Once he was in the forest, he saw a bowl filled with money. He took the money and put it in his pocket. All of a sudden, he thought about what the old woman said, that he mustn't take anything except the root."},{"14":"He took the money out his pocket and put it back in the bowl."},{"15":"He looked around and saw some splendid new clothes. He took off the clothes he was wearing and put on the new ones. Again he thought about what the old woman had said. He took off the new clothes and put his old ones back on."},{"16":"He looked around and saw the root. It was withered from the sun.

The people who lived there had been happy before, but then wild animals had come and had begun to frighten them. These animals ate all their crops and from time to time they even carried off children who wandered away from their parents. It was not a good place to live any longer, and the people began to think of where they might go to lead a new life."},{"03":""},{"04":"One family found the answer. Rather than deal with the wild animals who seemed to be everywhere on the flat land, they decided to go in search of food up in the hills. It was not hard to find food there. There were bushes that grew in the cracks between rocks. There were trees that grew at the foot of the slopes. There were rock rabbits which could be trapped and birds which could be brought down with the stones which littered the floor of the caves."},{"05":""},{"06":"Other families noticed how well the hill family was doing. They saw the sleekness of their children, and they noticed how calm the parents were. “It is a good life that we lead up in the hills,” said the husband. “You should come there too.” Soon the other families abandoned their homes on the flat land and went up to the hills. Each family found a cave to live in, and in this way they were warm and secure. Soon everybody talked about how sorry they were that they had not come to the hills earlier, rather than letting the wild animals eat their crops and drag off their children."},{"07":""},{"08":"As the children grew up in the hills, they began to get better at the things that had to be done to live in such a place. They became very quick at climbing rocks, and even the youngest could scamper up a face of rock almost as quickly as any rock rabbit. They also became good at climbing into trees to look for fruit, and they could swing in the branches almost as well as any monkey. People who passed by and saw the hill people living on their hill wondered whether they were perhaps wild animals, but when they saw their faces and the clothes that they were wearing they realised that they were only people who had made the hills their home."},{"09":""},{"10":"Slowly, things began to change. The parents noticed that their children were talking less, and that rather than speaking to one another in the language of people they were beginning to use grunts. Then the adults themselves noticed that their noses were getting bigger and that they were growing hairier. Every time they looked at one another they saw that their faces had changed yet more and that their teeth were longer. Soon they spent as much time on four legs as on two, and it was at this point that they became a new creature. This creature, which had never before been seen in that place, was the creature which people now call the baboon."},{"11":""},{"12":"For a time, the baboons lived happily. They stopped chasing the rock rabbits and started to eat grubs from the ground. They also forgot how to talk, and nobody now made any sound other than a bark or a grunt. They took off their clothes and let the rags lie on the ground until they were destroyed by ants. Their legs and arms were now completely covered with dark hair. They still remembered, though, that they had been people, and this was something which made them worried. When they looked into each other's faces, they realised that their noses were now much bigger than they had been before, and this made them jeer. Every baboon laughed at every other baboon, pointing at his enlarged nose and throwing his hands about in mirth. This made the baboon who was being laughed at angry. He would jump up and down in anger, all the while laughing at the large nose of the other."},{"13":""},{"14":"Eventually the mockery became so great that the baboons could no longer bear to be together. Each family split off and lived by itself, laughing at the others because of their great noses, but not liking to be laughed at for their own noses. That is why baboons live in small groups today and do not live as a baboon nation, as do people and many other animals."}]},{"i":"0263","t":"Queen of Soweto: The Story of Basetsana Kumalo","a":"b|Jessica Taylor|Mia du Plessis","s":[{"02":"Basetsana Makgalemele was born in a township called Soweto. She was her parents' third daughter. They named her Basetsana, which means “girls”. In Tswana culture, calling your daughter that means your next child will be a boy. This actually happened. Her parents' next child was a boy. Her parents, big sisters and younger brother all called her Bassie for short."},{"03":"When she was a child, Bassie was very shy. She liked to sing and dance in her room on her own. One day at school netball practice, the coach told two girls to pick teams. Bassie stood on the edge of the field hoping someone would say, “Come play with us!” But nobody wanted her on their team. Little did they know, Bassie would become one of the most popular girls in the country."},{"04":"On weekends, she and her brother and sisters helped their teacher mom and bus driver dad to pay the bills. They made sandwiches to sell at local soccer matches. They tried to sell everything as fast as they could so they had time to play with the other children when the game was over."},{"05":"By the time Bassie turned 16, she was a beautiful young woman. She was so beautiful that she won two beauty competitions in one year: Miss Soweto and Miss Black South Africa. But Bassie was not only beautiful on the outside. She was also beautiful on the inside. Even though she was a beauty queen, she still cared about the community where she grew up."},{"06":"Bassie was also very smart. She worked hard at school, especially on her favourite subject: science. Her hard work was rewarded when she was the top science student at her school in matric. That's not all, she was also Head Girl. The shy little girl was now one of the most popular girls in school."},{"07":"Bassie's father always encouraged his children to read. He gave her a book called The Power of Positive Thinking. From that book, she learnt that being optimistic is the key to making your dreams a reality. She dreamt of winning Miss South Africa. Not only did that dream come true, she was even crowned First Princess in the Miss World competition!"},{"08":"Bassie's mother was her role model. Bassie described her mom as a “fierce, hardworking Xhosa woman who did not suffer fools”. She was a teacher and Bassie had plans to follow in her footsteps, but things don't always go as planned! After winning Miss South Africa, she became a TV presenter. She wasn't a teacher, but like her mom, she was hardworking. Her career in TV led to her opening her own television production company. She was now a successful business woman."},{"09":"Bassie's motto is: “To whom much is given, much is expected.” She believes that you are given a gift so that you can give to others. Bassie does this by volunteering, giving of her time and money and even creating jobs. She is involved with projects and charities to help people in her community. One that is very close to her heart is the Nelson Mandela Institute."},{"10":"Bassie had a very close relationship with Nelson Mandela. When she was crowned Miss South Africa, Madiba wrote her a letter of congratulations. In the letter, he called her “our Queen”. They shared a passion for children and education and the belief that an educated nation can help fight poverty."},{"11":"Bassie married Romeo Kumalo and became known as Basetsana Kumalo. Together they established the Romeo & Basetsana Kumalo Family Foundation. The foundation looks after orphans - children who don't have a mom and dad."},{"12":"Bassie has had to learn to balance her busy work and family life. She has her own company called Basetsana Women Investment Holdings. She and Romeo have three children, two boys and a girl. Bassie sees her role as mother to her children as her “highest calling and greatest privilege”."},{"13":"Bassie says the secret to her success is “courage, determination, passion and staying committed to the course”. Despite all her success, she remains humble while trying to make the world a better place. Being beautiful on the outside is not what makes you a beautiful person. It's a heart filled with love and generosity.

Nonkungu's mother made a special skirt with ribbon, buttons and beads. She also made a beautiful bead necklace for Nonkungu. Then she sent her off to her uncle's village."},{"04":"On the way Nonkungu came to a stream. She crossed the stream using the stepping stones. On the other side she met a young girl wearing rags."},{"05":"\"Where are you going?\" asked the young girl. \"I'm going to visit my Uncle Mtonyama,\" said Nonkungu. \"Well, Mtonyama is my uncle, too and I am also on my way to visit him,\" said the young girl. So they walked on together."},{"06":"Before they had gone very far, the young girl said, \"Your skirt is so beautiful and your beads are so pretty. Please let me try them on.\" So Nonkungu took off her skirt and beads and gave them to the young girl."},{"07":"When the girl took off her rags and changed into Nonkungu's clothes, Nonkungu saw that the young girl had a tail! Nonkungu was afraid. She knew now that the young girl was really an imbulu."},{"08":"They walked on together. \"Please give me back my skirt and my beads,\" asked Nonkungu. But the imbulu answered, \"Let me wear them until we get to that tree.\" She pointed to a tree on the hill."},{"09":"When they reached the tree, Nonkungu said to the imbulu, \"Please give me back my skirt and beads.\" \"Just let me wear them until we get to the next stream,\" said the imbulu. Nonkungu was afraid, so she agreed."},{"10":"At last they reached the stream. Again Nonkungu asked the imbulu, \"Please give me back my skirt and my beads.\" \"Just let me wear them until we get to that hut where the women are sitting,\" said the imbulu. So they walked on."},{"11":"When they reached the hut, the imbulu pushed Nonkungu back and called to the women sitting by the hut. \"Look at this girl wearing rags. She has been following me all day. I wish she would go away,\" said the imbulu. Nonkungu was so ashamed and so frightened that she ran hid in the kraal."},{"12":"Then the imbulu went to Uncle Mtonyama's hut. She said sweetly, \"I am your niece, Nonkungu. My parents sent me to stay with you.\" Mtonyama welcomed the young girl. He and his family were very kind to the imbulu. But poor Nonkungu had to sleep in the kraal and share the dog's food."},{"13":"During the day Nonkungu went to the fields, hid in the corn, and sang: \"Oh misery me, misery me. I was sent by my father and mother to stay with my Uncle Mtonyama. On the way I met an imbulu and she took my skirt and my beads. Oh misery me, misery me.\""},{"14":"One day, one of Mtonyama's brothers was walking in the fields. He heard the strange and beautiful song. He didn't know who was singing, but when he got home, he told Mtonyama the words. Mtonyama went into the fields. He heard the song, and looked until he found Nonkungu."},{"15":"Nonkungu told him what had happened, how the imbulu had taken her beautiful clothes. Mtonyama took her back to his place and hid her in a hut. Mtonyama knew what he was going to do to catch the imbulu."},{"16":"Mtonyama had heard that an imbulu's tail loves milk and that it can't go past milk without drinking some. So he told his men to dig a deep ditch and to fill the ditch with sour milk. Then he called all the girls of the village to take part in a jumping competition."},{"17":"The imbulu was worried. She did not want to jump over the ditch. She knew that her tail would be thirsty for the sour milk. So she went into a hut and tied her tail to her body as tightly as she could. Then she took her place with the other girls."},{"18":"One girl after another jumped over the ditch. At last it was the imbulu's turn. She tried to jump high over the ditch, but her tail broke loose. The imbulu's tail pulled her down, down, down into the sour milk."},{"19":"As the imbulu struggled in the sour milk, the men quickly filled the ditch with sand and buried her. That was the end of the imbulu. Nonkungu stayed happily with her uncle for a long, long time.

He was asked to collect all the eggs, which the hens had laid all around the kraal."},{"05":"All day Sizwe looked for eggs, and when it was time to go home, he was given some eggs to take to his mother.

Sizwe tried to catch it, but he fell in the mud."},{"11":"The Chief's daughter saw Sizwe fall in the mud, but she did not laugh. She never even smiled.

I will do that next time,” said Sizwe."},{"12":"The next day, Sizwe had to work in the Chief's kitchen. He worked hard all day washing the dishes.

Helen didn't have many friends in the village, but she didn't mind. From the start, Helen did things differently from most people."},{"04":"After her sisters left home, Helen lived alone with her parents. She loved her mother, but she hated her father.

We watched over her, calling woowooh!"},{"09":"Helen decided she wanted brightness in her life. She began by changing the space around her. She needed helpers. Three men from the village, Jonas Adams, Piet van der Merwe, and Koos Malgas, made the things she imagined out of wire and cement. She filled her back garden with interesting creatures. There were sphinxes and camels, mermaids and cats. And lots and lots of owls! She called it her camel yard. On the fence she made a wire sign. It said: \"This is my world.\""},{"10":"During the day Helen made sculptures. At night, she practised catching light. She collected glasses and mirrors, candles and lamps. Anything that would shine. She put lanterns in every room. Mirrors caught and reflected the light. She covered the walls in glittering glass so that they could shine too. After Helen's father died, she had the house to herself. Each night she slept in a different room. She would always choose the one with the best view of the moon and the stars."},{"11":"The people of Nieu Bethesda would walk past Helen's garden and marvel at the creatures in it. Some of the village children brought her glass bottles for her sculptures and called her \"Miss Helen.\" She always thanked them with sweets. Others were not so friendly.

In her diary she wrote: \"In my loneliness I am happy.\""},{"12":"The garden grew and grew, until there was hardly space left for any more creatures. Miss Helen was tired now.

And her world was getting darker and darker. She knew that soon she wouldn't be able to see anything at all."},{"13":"But when she closed her eyes for the last time, Miss Helen didn't see darkness.

That way we can escape and my father will never find us.”"},{"12":"Back at the palace, king Kayanja had discovered Princess Apenyo's disappearance and ordered his subjects to search for her everywhere in the village. The king's guards, soldiers, and everyone else searched, but they couldn't find Princess Apenyo.

One day her mother told Tselane that they were moving to a nearby village to start a new life."},{"03":"Tselane did not want to leave her village and she cried very hard. Her mother was scared to leave her alone because this village was known to have many giants living in caves nearby. But Tselane cried so much that her mother gave in and agreed that she could stay behind."},{"04":"Tselane's mother said that she would bring her food every day. “I will sing a song and you will know that it's me. Don't open the door for anyone else, my child,” said Tselane's mother."},{"05":"Tselane my child! Tselane my child! Come out and eat your porridge! Come out and eat your porridge! Tselane ngwanaka! Tselane ngwanaka! Tla o tseye bogobe o je. Tla o tseye bogobe o je!"},{"06":"The next morning Tselane's mother came to the house to bring Tselane her food. She started singing: Tselane my child! Come out and eat your porridge! Tselane opened the door and ate her mother's delicious food."},{"07":"Her mother kissed her and went back to her home. Tselane went back inside her house and prepared her bed. But a giant was hiding behind the bushes, watching and listening to Tselane and her mother!"},{"08":"When Tselane switched off her light, she heard a deep voice singing her mother's song outside the door: Tselane my child! Come out and eat your porridge! “Go away! You are not my mother!” said Tselane.“You are a giant!” The giant walked away disappointed and disappeared into the caves."},{"09":"Every morning and every evening, Tselane's mother brought her food. Every morning and every evening, the giant also came. But each time Tselane sent him away. She recognised his deep voice as he tried to sing her mother's song."},{"10":"One day the giant came up with an idea: “I can change my voice to resemble that of Tselane's mother!” He made a big fire and threw a round smooth stone into the fire. When the stone was very hot and red, he took it out of the fire and swallowed it! “Kudutlu!” went the hot stone through the throat of the giant."},{"11":"The giant started singing to hear if his voice had changed. He jumped for joy when he heard his voice sounding as sweet as that of Tselane's mother!"},{"12":"Early the next day, the giant went to Tselane's house very early in the morning. When he got to the door of the house, he started singing: Tselane my child! Tselane my child! Come out and eat your porridge! Come out and eat your porridge! Tselane ngwanaka! Tselane ngwanaka! Tla o tseye bogobe o je. Tla o tseye bogobe o je!"},{"13":"Tselane was excited to hear her mother's sweet voice. She opened the door, and there was the giant! She tried to close the door but the giant was too quick. He grabbed Tselane and threw her into a sack."},{"14":"The giant walked back to his cave, singing and happy. “If only I had traditional beer, it would go so well with my dinner tonight. What a beautiful day!” he said to himself."},{"15":"A little later in the morning, Tselane's mother came as usual to bring her daughter food. She sang her song, but Tselane did not come out. She sang her song again, but still Tselane did not come out. After singing for the third time, she kicked the door open. Tselane was nowhere to be found. She knew what had happened, and she quickly thought of a plan."},{"16":"She poured some beer into a big calabash, put it on her head, walked down to the caves and knocked on the giant's door. The giant smelled the delicious smell of traditional beer and opened the door quickly. “Good evening, giant!” said Tselane's mother. “I was passing through and I heard you singing beautifully. I am going to another village for a child's birthday party.”"},{"17":"The giant was not going to let the opportunity of drinking traditional beer pass him by! He invited Tselane's mother into his cave. “Let me pour you some beer before I get back on the road,” said Tselane's mother. The giant was very happy and drank the beer in one gulp."},{"18":"Tselane's mother gave him more and more - and more - until the calabash was empty. By now the giant was so drunk that he fell asleep on the floor."},{"19":"When Tselane's mother heard the giant's loud snores, she opened the sack and out jumped Tselane. Tselane and her mother ran home as fast as they could. From then on Tselane lived with her mother at the new village – very happily!"}]},{"i":"0084","t":"Demane and Demazane","a":"b|South African Folktale|Jemma Kahn","s":[{"02":"Once upon a time, there was a boy called Demane. He had a twin sister called Demazane. When their mother and father died, they went to stay with their uncle. But they were badly treated. They were beaten with long sticks, and given thin porridge only once a day for food. So they ran away."},{"03":"They found a cave to live in. They were scared because they had heard that there were cannibals living in the hills. So they made a strong door to cover the entrance, with only two holes to let in air and light. Demane warned his sister, “Stay in the cave while I am out hunting, and don't cook any meat. Cannibals love the smell of cooking meat.”"},{"04":"Each evening Demane brought back something he had killed – a hare or some birds or a small buck. As he came to the cave, he sang, “Demazane, Demazane, child of my mother, open this cave to me. The swallows can enter it. It has two holes.”"},{"05":"Demazane found it very boring to stay in the cave all day. So one day, when her brother had gone, she went out to explore. She found a stream to play in, and some trees to climb. She felt free and happy. “Perhaps,” she thought, “there are no cannibals. Perhaps Uncle said there were cannibals just to frighten us.”"},{"06":"The next day she felt bold enough to make a fire to warm herself. But she made it inside the cave with the door firmly shut – just to be on the safe side. “I'm sure it won't matter if I put a little meat on the fire. It will be so good to have a cooked meal.”"},{"07":"When her brother came home he sang as usual, “Demazane, Demazane, child of my mother, open this cave to me. The swallows can enter it. It has two holes.” She opened the door and let him in. When he saw the cooked meat, Demane asked, “How did you do this without a fire?” “I dried the meat in the sun outside the cave,” Demazane replied quickly. Demane was too tired to argue, and they sat down to enjoy the meal together."},{"08":"The next day, she made a fire and cooked meat again. She had just finished when a voice sang outside the door, “Demazane, Demazane, child of my mother, open this cave to me. The swallows can enter it. It has two holes.” But the voice did not sound like her brother's. Demazane said, “No. You are not my brother. Your voice is not like his.” She felt safe in the cave."},{"09":"A little while later, someone was singing outside the cave again, “Do let me in, my sister.” “Demazane, Demazane, child of my mother, open this cave to me. The swallows can enter it. It has two holes.” The voice sounded just like her brother's, so she opened the door."},{"10":"A huge hairy man filled the opening of the cave. He grabbed Demazane before she could run away. Demazane just had time to pick up some ashes from the fire. As she was being carried away, she dropped some ashes here and there along the path."},{"11":"That day, all Demane had managed to trap was a hive full of bees. He carried them in a thick bag slung over his shoulder. When he came to the cave, he found the door open and his sister gone…but ashes pointing the way into the woods. He followed the ash along the path until he saw a fire in the distance."},{"12":"Near the fire was a huge hairy man sitting with a large bag next to him. Demane walked up to the man, pretending to limp, “Please, father, can you help me? I've hurt my leg. I need some water.” The man replied, “I'll get you some water, if you will promise not to touch my bag.” And he put the bag carefully in his hut."},{"13":"But when he had gone, Demane cut the string of the bag, and out climbed his sister. Demane replaced the bag with his own bag full of bees. Brother and sister hid and waited to see what would happen."},{"14":"When the man came with the water, his son and daughter came with him. He said to his daughter, “There is something nice in the bag in our hut. Go! Bring it!” She opened the bag a little to see what it was, but the bees stung her hand, and she called out, “It is biting.” “Go and help her!” he shouted to his son. But the result was the same."},{"15":"“Don't treat me like a fool,” he shouted, and stormed into the hut. He closed the door and opened the bag himself. The angry bees swarmed out and stung his head, his nose, his eyes. Blinded, he jumped about, howling with pain."},{"16":"Then he ran and fell headlong into a pond, where his head stuck fast in the mud. He turned into a piece of wood like the stump of a tree. Just right for a bee hive. For a long time after that, Demane and Demazane ate delicious honey from that hive."}]},{"i":"0227","t":"The Smell Thief","a":"n|Joanne Bloch (retold folktale)|Rebecca Riley,Nalibali","s":[{"02":"Mr Shabangu was the best baker in town. Every morning he woke up at four o'clock to mix and knead the dough for his famous buns, cakes and biscuits."},{"03":"By eight o'clock the people of the town were walking past the bakery on their way to work and school. By this time the cakes and buns were almost cooked, and the most delicious smells wafted out of the bakery's windows."},{"04":"Many of the people went into the bakery to buy their breakfast. Mr Shabangu smiled happily at them as he passed them the fresh, tasty cinnamon buns and warm, golden biscuits that were so famous in the town."},{"05":"But other people were not so lucky. Because they had so little money, the poorer people of the town could hardly ever afford to buy any of the delicious buns, cakes and biscuits. All they could do was enjoy the lovely smells that drifted out of the bakery windows. When Mr Shabangu noticed these people sniffing the air near his bakery, he said angrily, ‘How dare they sniff my delicious smells!'"},{"06":"‘Those are MY smells. I made them, so they belong to me! If people want to smell my wonderful smells, they should pay for them!' He huffed and puffed and wiped the sweat from his brow, before turning back the oven to bake some bread and rolls for his lunchtime customers."},{"07":"One old woman especially loved the smells that drifted out of the bakery window every morning. This was Ma Shange who slept on a bench in the park every night."},{"08":"A few weeks before, a kind person had given her the money to buy herself a cinnamon bun. She had taken the bun back to the park and ate it very slowly, licking her lips and sharing the last crumbs with the birds."},{"09":"After that, although the old woman didn't have enough money to buy breakfast, she longed for the delicious bun again. So every morning she walked slowly past Mr Shabangu's bakery, sniffing the air and smiling blissfully at the mouthwatering smell."},{"10":"Ma Shange's new habit made the baker very angry. As each day went by, he grew angrier and angrier with her. Finally, one winter morning when he was in an especially bad mood, he stormed out of his bakery and grabbed the old woman by the arm. ‘How dare you steal my smells!' he shouted. ‘You're nothing but a smell thief!' He wiped his hands on an apron, then pulled it off and threw it back into the bakery."},{"11":"‘This is the last day this cheeky woman will steal my smells!' he shouted. And with these words, he dragged Ma Shange off to the court to see judge Ngwenya. The judge was sitting down at his huge, shiny desk when the angry baker stormed in, dragging the quivering and confused Ma Shange with him."},{"12":"‘Good morning,' said the judge in his deep voice. ‘Sir,' said Mr Shabangu furiously, ‘I demand justice! I wish to lay a complaint against this woman. Every day for the last three weeks, she has walked past my bakery early in the morning when my delicious smells are at their best, and stolen them. I demand that she pays for those smells!'"},{"13":"And with these words, he dragged Ma Shange off to the court to see judge Ngwenya.

I wish to lay a complaint against this woman. Every day for the last three weeks, she has walked past my bakery early in the morning when my delicious smells are at their best, and stolen them."},{"15":"The judge scratched his big, bald head for a moment. Then he cleared his throat. ‘Fair enough,' he said to the baker. ‘Justice will be done.' He turned to Ma Shange. ‘How much money do you have on you, Madam?' he asked."},{"16":"‘Only two rands,' stammered Ma Shange. ‘Well,' said the judge, hand it to me, please.' Meekly, Ma Shange reached into the pocket of her tatty old cardigan and pulled out two one rand coins. She handed them to the judge. He took them, thanking her politely."},{"17":"Then he shook the coins in his big fist, so that they made a clinking sound. ‘This is my judgement,' he said to the baker. ‘The punishment must fit the crime. Therefore the sound of Ma Shange's money is the payment you will get for the smells she stole. And now I wish you a good day.' The baker looked thoughtful. Then, realising how unreasonable he had been, he turned slowly and walked out of the room."},{"18":"The judge smiled kindly at Ma Shange, and handed her back her money. 'Now, Madam, he said pulling a brown paper bag from his briefcase, would you care to join me for breakfast? These buns are still warm, I bought them only half an hour ago.'"}]},{"i":"0052","t":"Simbegwire","a":"b|Rukia Nantale|Benjamin Mitchley","s":[{"02":"When Simbegwire's mother died, she was very sad. Simbegwire's father did his best to take care of his daughter. Slowly, they learned to feel happy again, without Simbegwire's mother. Every morning they sat and talked about the day ahead. Every evening they made dinner together. After they washed the dishes, Simbegwire's father helped her with homework."},{"03":"One day, Simbegwire's father came home later than usual. “Where are you my child?” he called. Simbegwire ran to her father. She stopped still when she saw that he was holding a woman's hand. \"I want you to meet someone special, my child. This is Anita,\" he said smiling."},{"04":"“Hello Simbegwire, your father told me a lot about you,” said Anita. But she did not smile or take the girl's hand. Simbegwire's father was happy and excited. He talked about the three of them living together, and how good their life would be. \"My child, I hope you will accept Anita as your mother,\" he said."},{"05":"Simbegwire's life changed. She no longer had time to sit with her father in the mornings. Anita gave her so many household chores that she was too tired to do her school work in the evenings. She went straight to bed after dinner. Her only comfort was the colourful blanket her mother gave her. Simbegwire's father did not seem to notice that his daughter was unhappy."},{"06":"After a few months, Simbegwire's father told them that he would be away from home for a while. \"I have to travel for my job,\" he said. \"But I know you will look after each other.\" Simbegwire's face fell, but her father did not notice. Anita did not say anything. She was not happy either."},{"07":"Things got worse for Simbegwire. If she didn't finish her chores, or she complained, Anita hit her. And at dinner, the woman ate most of the food, leaving Simbegwire with only a few scraps. Each night Simbegwire cried herself to sleep, hugging her mother's blanket."},{"08":"One morning, Simbegwire was late getting out of bed. “You lazy girl!” Anita shouted. She pulled Simbegwire out of bed. The precious blanket caught on a nail, and tore in two."},{"09":"Simbegwire was very upset. She decided to run away from home. She took the pieces of her mother's blanket, packed some food, and left the house. She followed the road her father had taken."},{"10":"When it came to evening, she climbed a tall tree near a stream and made a bed for herself in the branches. As she went to sleep, she sang: “Maama, maama, maama, you left me. You left me and never came back. Father doesn't love me anymore. Mother, when are you coming back? You left me.”"},{"11":"The next morning, Simbegwire sang the song again. When the women came to wash their clothes at the stream, they heard the sad song coming from the tall tree. They thought it was only the wind rustling the leaves, and carried on with their work. But one of the women listened very carefully to the song."},{"12":"This woman looked up into the tree. When she saw the girl and the pieces of colourful blanket, she cried, “Simbegwire, my brother's child!” The other women stopped washing and helped Simbegwire to climb down from the tree. Her aunt hugged the little girl and tried to comfort her."},{"13":"Simbegwire's aunt took the child to her own house. She gave Simbegwire warm food, and tucked her in bed with her mother's blanket. That night, Simbegwire cried as she went to sleep. But they were tears of relief. She knew her aunt would look after her."},{"14":"When Simbegwire's father returned home, he found her room empty. \"What happened, Anita?\" he asked with a heavy heart. The woman explained that Simbegwire had run away. \"I wanted her to respect me,\" she said. \"But perhaps I was too strict.\" Simbegwire's father left the house and went in the direction of the stream. He continued to his sister's village to find out if she has seen Simbegwire."},{"15":"Simbegwire was playing with her cousins when she saw her father from far away. She was scared he might be angry, so she ran inside the house to hide. But her father went to her and said, “Simbegwire, you have found a perfect mother for yourself. One who loves you and understands you. I am proud of you and I love you.” They agreed that Simbegwire would stay with her aunt as long as she wanted to."},{"16":"Her father visited her every day. Eventually, he came with Anita. She reached out for Simbegwire's hand. \"I'm so sorry little one, I was wrong,\" she cried. \"Will you let me try again?\" Simbegwire looked at her father and his worried face. Then she stepped forward slowly and put her arms around Anita."},{"17":"The next week, Anita invited Simbegwire, with her cousins and aunt, to the house for a meal. What a feast! Anita prepared all of Simbegwire's favourite foods, and everyone ate until they were full. Then the children played while the adults talked. Simbegwire felt happy and brave.

And this pot is so heavy. Let's sit in the shade of the tree and rest a bit.\" She wipes the sweat from her face and makes herself comfortable among the arms of the roots. Selma stands with her hand on the smooth skin of the baobab while her brother, Toivo, walks round the trunk to see how wide it is. \"This tree is very old, isn't it, Grandmother?\" \"Yes, Selma, it is. But it is not as old, or as big as the tree at the village of Ombalantu!\" \"Ombalantu? The village near here?\" asks Selma. \"Please tell us about the tree there,\" begs Toivo. \"Then sit and listen,\" says Grandmother and she begins her story."},{"03":"There was once a girl called Thaimi who lived in the village of Ombalantu. One day she went with her brother, Angula, to fetch water. While Thaimi was filling her pot Angula saw a hare. He ran after it. He ran and ran and ran - but do you think he could catch that hare? He could not. The hare was too quick for him. Thaimi's pot was full and she was ready to go home. She looked around but she could not see Angula. She did not know where he had gone. But, she did know that she couldn't go home without her little brother. So she set out to look for him. She walked and she walked and she walked. At last she found him lying in the grass behind a large anthill. As she came close he held his finger to his lips. Why did he want her to be quiet? Close by a group of strange men were resting. The men had bows and arrows...and spears! Thaimi could hear their voices. \"Angula,\" she whispered, after she had listened for a bit. \"Those men are raiders. They have come to steal our cattle and burn our village. Come quickly. We must run home and warn the village.\" So very quietly Thaimi and Angula crept away from that place. And ran towards their village."},{"04":"When they were near their village they met their uncle. He was taking his cow to the water. Thaimi called out, \"Run, uncle, run! Men are coming to steal our cattle and burn our village.\" The man shouted at his cow and made her run towards the village. Further on Thaimi saw her aunt working in the field and she called out, \"Run, aunt, run! Men are coming to steal our cattle and burn our village!\" And the woman took her hoe, picked up her sleeping baby and ran towards the village. Further on Thaimi saw her grandfather. He was limping along the road beside a donkey loaded with grain. And she called out, \"Run, Grandfather, run! Men are coming to steal our cattle and burn our village!\" Her grandfather lifted his stick and chased the donkey until it ran towards the village."},{"05":"And so Thaimi and her brother reached the village. And she called out to everyone, \"Run, run. Men are coming to steal our cattle and burn our village!\" The villagers were scared. They ran backwards and forwards like ants when a heap is trodden on by a cow. They did not know where to hide or what to do. Where could they hide their cattle? Where could they hide their grain? Where could they hide themselves? Thaimi was very frightened. Then she remembered something. She remembered the place where she and Angula sometimes went to play. A safe place. A secret place."},{"06":"\"I have a place!\" she cried. \"I know a place where we will all be safe!\" But the villagers could not hear her. They were making too much noise. How could she make the villagers listen to her? What do you think Thaimi did? She picked up a drum and began to hit it as hard as she could. \"Bam Bam Bam Boom Boom Boom.\" All the villagers stopped. Thaimi called out, \"I have a place to hide. Follow me.\" She took Angula by the arm. \"Come, we'll take everyone to our tree. We will all be safe there!\" Her brother shook his head. \"No, Thaimi. That is our secret. You said we must never tell anyone.\" \"Yes\", she said. \"It was a secret. But now we are all in danger.\" Thaimi and Angula led the way to a baobab tree which stood nearby. Nobody could understand why."},{"07":"\"Why have you brought us here? We cannot hide here,\" they said. Then Thaimi said to her father, \"Come. I'll show you.\" They climbed to the top of the tree. There was a small opening. Thaimi and her father slid down into the big trunk. It was hollow. It was huge. \"But all the people can't come in through such a small hole,\" said her father. \"No,\" said Thaimi. \"Bring axes and we will make an opening in the trunk.\" And that is what they did. They cut an opening in the side of the tree. Some villagers collected the grain and the pots. Others collected the goats, the sheep and the cattle. They all made their way through the opening into the great hollow inside the baobab tree. And the strange thing was that there was room for everyone."},{"08":"The sun went down. It grew dark and the night was quiet and cold. The raiders crept up towards the village. It was dark. \"Everyone must be asleep,\" they said. Inside the great tree the villagers waited. What was going to happen? They were cold. They were hungry. And they were afraid. Then Thaimi said, \"It's cold. Let's make a fire.\" And she took two stones and struck them together. The sparks caught the grass and small flames flared. Soon a bright warm fire was burning."},{"09":"Outside the raiders crept closer and closer. Then suddenly one of them gave a cry and pointed to the tree. Light flamed from the tree. Fiery eyes shone from the trunk. Bright tongues licked the branches. Smoke curled into the sky. \"It's a great spirit!\" they cried in fear. First one raider turned and ran. Then another, and another. Until they had all run away. The people of the village of Ombalantu were saved."},{"10":"Grandmother is silent.

He scolded her and hit her with a stick. Nosisa ran off to the river where she sat and cried the whole afternoon. Suddenly she heard a voice coming out of the river. She looked up and saw a big fish. The voice was coming from the fish. Nosisa was so shocked she almost ran away, but the fish stopped her. “Please don't run away my daughter, I am your mother. I have changed myself into a fish so that your father does not know it's me.”"},{"09":"“What is the matter?” asked the fish. Nosisa told the fish everything about her sad life. “Don't worry my girl. I will bring you food every day,” said the fish. The fish gave fresh vegetables to Nosisa. She had a feast. When she looked up the fish was gone. That day Nosisa went home smiling. She would not have to go to bed without food as usual."},{"10":"Nosisa went to the river every day. In the morning she woke up as usual and did her chores around the house. At midday, she went to the river. She called out every time, and every time the fish would appear with delicious food. Nosisa became happier and happier. She could talk to the fish about anything. She started to regain her health. Her skin was glowing and she was a happy child."},{"11":"Nosisa visited the fish every day until her stepmother became suspicious. Nosisa had gained weight and she was glowing. “Something is going on at the river, I must find out what it is,” thought the stepmother. One afternoon she followed Nosisa to the river. She saw Nosisa talking to the fish, and getting delicious food. Nosisa's secret was out. “I have to do something about this fish,” said the stepmother."},{"12":"In the evening, Mpunzi came back from the fields. He found his new wife crying in her hut. “What is wrong my lovely wife,” asked Mpunzi. “I went to a traditional doctor,” said the wife. “He told me that the only way for me to give you a son is to eat the biggest fish that lives in this nearby river,” she said. “Will you catch the fish for me tonight?” pleaded the woman. “I will do anything for you my beautiful wife,” said Mpunzi."},{"13":"Mpunzi set off to the river before it was too dark. He took his servants to help him find the biggest fish in that river. They searched and searched and eventually Mpunzi caught the biggest fish. He put it in a bag and went home with it.

I wonder why he is still sleeping.”"},{"15":"“Anyway, now I can run to the river for a nice breakfast,” she thought. Nosisa ran to the river. When she got there she called out to the fish, and she called again and again. The fish never came. Nosisa started to cry. She did not know what had happened to the fish. While she was crying a bird came to sit next to her and told her what had happened. She cried harder thinking that her mother had been caught and eaten."},{"16":"The bird told her to collect the fish bones from the table and throw them back into the river. If she did that the fish would come back to life. The bird also told her to let her father and stepmother sleep and wake them up only at midday. Nosisa did as she was told. She ran back home and walked quietly into her father's hut. They were still fast asleep. She took the bones, put them inside a bag and threw them back into the river."},{"17":"Nosisa ran back home and just before midday she woke her father and stepmother. She could hardly recognise them. They looked old and grey and frail. They were too old to scold her. They were too weak to hit her. They were too tired to look after the homestead.

Owl owned the sun, water and fire. Dima did not have any of these things and lived in darkness with his family."},{"03":"Dima tried to make a garden, but he could not grow vegetables because there was no sun. Everybody suffered because there was no sun. When they hunted animals to eat, they hung the meat in the trees to dry, but it rotted because there was no sun."},{"04":"One day, Dima decided to visit Owl. When they served food, Dima wondered why Owl's food tasted so good. He wondered if it was because the food grew in the sun and it was cooked in fire. Secretly, Dima made a plan. He decided to dance. He wanted everyone at Owl's place to gather around him and see him dance. He was a good dancer. Owl and his family admired the beautiful dancing."},{"05":"When it grew dark, Owl decided to fetch the sun from his house so that he could still watch Dima's dancing. Owl kept the sun in an animal skin bag inside his hut. He carried the sun out from his house and held it high up above his shoulders. Now it was light. Everyone could see far into the distance. Soon everyone was dancing in the light of the sun."},{"06":"Dima crept closer to the sun while he was dancing. Owl held on to the sun but after a while he forgot about it because he enjoyed the dancing so much. He saw how beautifully Dima danced. He too wanted to dance like this."},{"07":"Suddenly, Dima took his fighting stick and hit the sun into the air like a ball. The sun travelled so far that it remained forever in the sky. It gave everyone light all day."},{"08":"Dima ran away so fast that Owl could not find him. He stayed far away for a long time. After a while, he disguised himself and went back to Owl's place. The children recognised him and said: “There is the man who stole our sun!” The adults did not agree with the children and said, “No, this is not the man who stole our sun.”"},{"09":"They saw that this man was an old dancer. He wore a lot of beads around his body. They were magic dancing beads and they made people dance. It was not long before everyone was dancing. They danced the whole afternoon, until the sun began to set. It became too dark to see the magic dancer."},{"10":"Owl said to his wife, “Go and look in my bag and fetch the moon.” Owl held the moon high above his shoulders and it lit up the darkness for all to see the dance. While they were dancing, Dima moved closer and closer to the moon, for he had a plan."},{"11":"He took his fighting stick and hit the moon high up into the air. Once again, he ran away from Owl. This time he stayed away for a very long time, until Owl's family forgot all about him."},{"12":"Dima disguised himself again and returned to Owl's place. This time he wanted Owl's fire. Owl had the firesticks hanging around his neck. Dima joined Owl under a tree and the two men started playing an old clapping game called gi."},{"13":"They clapped and clapped and as they clapped some more, Owl's firesticks started jumping around his chest to the rhythm of the clapping. Clap-clap, clap-clap. Dima tried to grab the firesticks, but Owl threw them over his neck so that they hung across his back.  They clapped the whole day long. The rhythm of the clapping made Owl forget all about the firesticks. When they swung around onto his chest once more, Dima grabbed the firesticks and ran away. Owl and his family ran after Dima, but he made a clever plan. He had a bag full of thorns and threw them onto the ground behind him. This stopped Owl and his family from chasing him. They could not cross the thorns on the path."},{"14":"Dima could not wait to make fire. He rubbed and rubbed the sticks. He blew and blew the ember in a little dry grass until a tiny flame appeared. The fire grew and lit the whole veld and each time the flames reached a tree, Dima said, “From now on people will be able to make a fire with each tree on earth.”"},{"15":"A long time passed. When Dima finally returned to Owl's place, he found no one but a little boy playing with wooden animals. Dima asked the boy to show him where they kept their water. The boy led him to the place of water. Dima saw the big djaba, the huge clay pot in which the family stored water.  Dima pretended to leave for his home, but he secretly turned round to the place of water. He turned the huge pot over so that the water started flowing on the ground. Dima quickly jumped over the flowing water to the other side. Then he was safely across the river of water where Owl could not find him."},{"16":"This is why the whole earth has rivers full of water today. This is why we have the sun, moon and fire, because of the magician Dima."},{"17":"Story notes In 2003, Katunga Carimbwe told this version of the Dima and Owl origin story to Titu Mangumbu and Marlene Winberg in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa while he was busy painting on a canvas. Mangumbu, Mahongo and Winberg translated it and retold the story in this written version with as few alterations as possible. His elders told the story to him during his childhood in Mavinga, Angola, where he was born in 1958. Most of the episodes in the Dima and Owl myth have a wide distribution in the extensive area of southern Africa and the Kalahari whose original inhabitants speak !Xun and other closely related languages, although the names and identities of the trickster, Dima, and his adversary change from area to area. The “clapping game” mentioned in our version, Dima and Owl, is still current among the !xun, the Nharo, and possibly other communities of Kalahari San. This story depicts Dima as a culture hero and transformer of the primeval world into the present world. He achieves this with words, “From now on people will be able to make a fire with each tree on earth.” The Manyeka Arts Trust holds a !Xun audio telling of this story by Meneputo Mnaunga Maneka in archive."}]},{"i":"0173","t":"The Rain Bird","a":"n|Joanne Bloch (retold folktale)|Wiehan de Jager,Nalibali","s":[{"02":"In a country called Gabon, a little village stood at the very edge of a forest. In the heart of this forest, in the highest branches of an enormous tree, lived a very special bird − the bird that made rain."},{"03":"For as far back as the villagers could remember, they had taken the time to keep this bird happy. They saved scraps of bread, pieces of fruit and fresh coconut milk, and every week or two a group of villagers took these delicacies into the forest. When they had laid them at the base of the tree, one of them played a simple tune on the thumb piano."},{"04":"After a while, the bird flew down to the ground to eat and drink. When she had finished, she began to sing the most beautiful song. At the same time, she raised her dark, shiny blue wings, and within minutes, the rain began to fall."},{"05":"This went on for many years. Because the rain fell regularly, the crops grew abundantly and there was plenty of food in the village. But gradually things began to change. Somehow, the villagers were always busy and they began to neglect the rain bird. \"It will rain anyway,\" they said. \"It's time to stop spoiling that silly old bird!\""},{"06":"But the people were wrong. When they stopped looking after the bird, the rain stopped falling. The crops began to dry up and die, and the animals grew thin and weak. Still, nobody in the village went into the forest to feed the bird that brought the rain. Now they were all too busy trying to find money to buy food in the neighbouring town."},{"07":"One scorching day, a young girl called Ketti decided to go into the forest after school. \"At least it will be cool in there,\" she thought to herself. She walked and walked, and after some time, she came to the tall tree in which the rain bird lived. Ketti stared up at the tree. Suddenly, she remembered how her granny had taken her into the forest to feed the bird when she was still a tiny child. Ketti opened her school bag and pulled out a piece of bread left over from her lunch. Carefully she laid the bread at the base of the tree. Then, because she had no thumb piano with her, she sang an old song that she had known all her life."},{"08":"With a loud whooshing sound, a beautiful blue bird swooped out of the branches above Ketti's head and began to eat the bread. When the bird had finished, she opened her mouth and sang a few pure, high notes. Then she raised her shiny wings and all of a sudden Ketti heard the rumble of thunder. By the time she reached her home, giant rain drops were pelting down, cooling the baking red earth."},{"09":"Ketti was very happy, until she told her parents what had happened. \"Don't be silly!\" scolded her mother. \"Nobody believes that bird has anything to do with the rain anymore!\" \"Your mother is right,\" said Ketti's father. \"The drought has been broken now and we will be fine. Don't go wasting good bread feeding that greedy old bird again!\" Though Ketti didn't argue with her parents, she felt sure they were wrong. \"If only Granny were still alive,\" she said to herself, \"she would have believed me!\" But Ketti's granny had died a few years earlier. The only thing Ketti had left, was her granny's old thumb piano."},{"10":"Two weeks passed and there was no more rain. The crops began to shrivel up again and the hungry animals' ribs began to stick out even more. The sun beat down mercilessly from a glaring blue sky. \"I don't care what they say!\" thought Ketti. \"We need rain. I'm going to feed the bird again tomorrow!\""},{"11":"So, early the next morning, after taking a slice of bread and a handful of red berries from the kitchen, Ketti slipped out of the house. She began to make her way to the centre of the forest. What she didn't realise, was that her father was also awake. When he saw what his daughter was doing, he realised that she was going to feed the rain bird again."},{"12":"\"I'll teach that disobedient child a lesson!\" he said to himself angrily. He snatched his bow and arrows and silently followed Ketti into the forest. Just as the bird flew down to eat the food that Ketti had set out for it, her father raised his bow and released his deadly arrow. The arrow flew straight into the bird's heart. The bird let out a piercing shriek. Terrified, Ketti spun around − just in time to see her father fall down, stone dead. Ketti screamed and turned around − just in time to see the arrow fall harmlessly from the bird's glossy body. Then the bird, unharmed, swooped up into the highest branch of the tree."},{"13":"Ketti raced out of the forest to a scene of utter devastation. Every animal and every person she saw lay dead on the ground. With a pounding heart, she ran all the way back to her home. She quickly found her granny's old thumb piano. \"This is my only hope!\" she thought. \"The rain bird is angry. I have to make her happy again! I HAVE to!\""},{"14":"Half an hour later, Ketti was back at the base of the big tree. Her body was drenched with sweat and she was gasping for breath. A few paces away from her lay the lifeless body of her father. Ketti looked away quickly, and with trembling hands, began to play the thumb piano. She played and played, until her fingers hurt."},{"15":"Finally, what she wanted most in the world happened. Down swooped the bird as if nothing had happened. The bird ate some of the berries still lying on the ground and sang a few notes. Then, as Ketti played on, the bird raised her wings. Ketti heard a rustle behind her."},{"16":"It was her father who had woken up. \"I'm sorry!\" he said again and again to the big, blue bird. Then he held out his hand to his daughter and they walked slowly back to the village. In the village all the people and animals were alive again."},{"17":"That night the villagers held a meeting. They all agreed that they had learned a valuable lesson. And from that day onwards, not one week passed without a special trip to the forest to feed the bird that brought the rain."}]},{"i":"0202","t":"Refiloe and the washed chickens","a":"b|Marion Drew|Wiehan de Jager","s":[{"02":"It was the first wedding in the Tenane family, and Refiloe had never been so excited in her life. \"I'm going to be Palesa's bridesmaid, with a new dress and shoes!\" she said to her chickens.

Katitu Momambo was the youngest of the three. She was small but clever and wise. The three big girls went into the veld one day to gather food and wood. Little Katitu ran after them, but the sisters sent her back. “Go back Katitu! You are too small to go with us! Stay at home!” they said. Katitu did not pay attention to them. She followed them from a distance."},{"03":"When they noticed her, they were too far away from home to send her back, so she joined them. While she was walking behind them, Katitu cut herself some wood. She made herself a bow and many arrows. The girls walked and walked and walked until the sun dropped into the Kalahari horizon. They were lost. They walked into a deserted village and found a hut in which to spend the night."},{"04":"An old woman was sitting next to the hut. Little Katitu went and greeted her. “Oh?” answered the old woman, “This is the village of the Big Snake! He stays in a big hole in the cattle kraal. When people come to milk the cows, he eats them! He will go to your hut at night when you sleep and kill you there!”"},{"05":"Wise little Katitu did not panic. She asked the old woman for a hard cow skin to cover the door of their sleeping hut. Then Katitu wanted to sleep a little, so that she could stay awake throughout the night. “When the wind begins to blow,” she said to her sisters, “you must wake me up.” The wind came up, the sisters awoke Katitu and went to sleep. Katitu fixed the hard cow skin against the door of the hut and made a little hole in the middle for her bow and arrows. Katitu heard the Big Snake approach."},{"06":"“Hai, gom-gom, hai, gom-gom, where are they?” sang the Big Snake. The little clever girl answered him with a chant, “Here they are, here they are!” Then the Big Snake rushed against the hard skin at the door of the hut. Little Katitu shot an arrow through the hole in the skin. Yes, the little girl killed the Big Snake."},{"07":"Then Katitu woke up the older girls. “Sister, sister, sister,” she whispered, “get up, get up, get up!”"},{"08":"And when the girls woke up they saw a big snake lying there. “Come, we have to take him back to his hole!” shouted Katitu. They rolled him up, rolled him up, rolled him up and they set him right back in his hole. “Hurry! We have to run!” And the girls ran and ran and ran."},{"09":"The next morning, the Big Snake's wife told his children to go and look for him. When his children found him lying dead in his hole, they screamed: “Father is dead! Quick, let us go after those girls!” All the snake's children went after the girls. Katitu told her sisters to turn into trees. When the snakes arrived at the spot where they had seen the girls, only trees were standing there. The snakes were tired and lay under the trees to sleep. When they were asleep, the girls turned back into human beings and ran on."},{"10":"The girls continued to run and were very tired and thirsty. Eventually, they saw a waterhole! None of older sisters wanted to scoop the water from the deep well. They asked Katitu to climb in as she was the smallest. “Will you help me out of the well if I climb into it?” asked Katitu. “Yes,” they replied, “we will help you.” Katitu went into the well and scooped water for her sisters."},{"11":"Each girl drank and then walked away. They all left Katitu in the deep well and walked home. Later that evening, the elephants came to drink. One of them drank and left. Another one drank and left. The last elephant drank and swallowed Katitu with the water! A few drops of Katitu's blood sprayed onto the reeds growing at the water hole."},{"12":"Meanwhile, Katitu's sisters had arrived home without any food or wood. They were crying and told the family that Katitu was lost. Everyone started searching for her. Katitu's little brother and his friend were searching too. They became very tired and rested next to a waterhole. They cut some reeds to make themselves flutes. When Katitu's brother played on his flute, the flute sang by itself: “Is this my brother who plays me, who plays me, The other girls left me, left me and the elephant swallowed me, swallowed me!” The boy rushed home and handed the reed to his father, who played it. And again, the reed sang: “Is this my father who plays me, plays me? The other girls left me, left me, and the elephant swallowed me, swallowed me!” The father handed the reed to Katitu's mother, who played it. And again, the reed sang: “Is this my mother who plays me, plays me? The other girls left me, left me, and the elephant swallowed me, swallowed me!”"},{"13":"Katitu's father called the young men of the homestead and ordered them to find the tracks of the elephants and find Katitu. The young men hurried off. They met the first group of elephants and asked them, “Elephants, elephants, have you seen the one who swallowed our girl?” And the elephants sang: “!a plaf! !a plaf! We trot lightly. We are so light, we carry nothing!” And they passed on."},{"14":"The young men met up with an old elephant in the bush and asked, “Old elephant, elephant, have you seen the one who swallowed our girl?”"},{"15":"The old elephant sang: “!a plaf! !a plaf! I trot lightly! I am so light, I carry nothing!” But now the young men heard a little voice in the belly of the elephant. “Cut him open! Go on, cut him on his left side, for I am sitting on his left side!” said the voice."},{"16":"They held the old elephant down and cut open his belly. There was little Katitu lying inside! The young men took her out and carried her home. Katitu was welcomed as a hero by the villagers. And that is the tale of Katitu Mamombo. The wise little girl who saved her sisters from the Big Snake, saved them from the snake's children, and (with the help of her brother) saved herself from the belly of the elephant. Of course, her sisters were punished."},{"17":"Story notes Ju|'hoan storyteller, Nxisae Magdaline Nxao, told a short version of this story in Dkar, Botswana, in 2005 (Winberg 2009).

Together we're strong!” Her stomach growled when the baby's powerful kicks woke her at night. She ate the leftover meat in the cooking pot, hungry for life."},{"03":"One bright night the moon was bigger, fatter and pinker than ever. Her breath came fast. The baby was ready. The aunties in the birthing room rubbed her back and warmed the water. When Monikazi held her beautiful daughter in her arms, she knew she was a special girl, a fighter. What a blessing! Her name is Nontsikelelo. She will be the mother of all blessings."},{"04":"Nontsikelelo was beautiful and strong with crinkling black button eyes. She loved her older brother, Mcengi. He made her laugh and so the laughter spread. She loved to eat meat before she had teeth. Her favourite aunt always kept a little portion on the side of her plate for Ntsiki. Mcengi chased the chickens that scratched in the garden where Ma Monikazi grew spinach and squash to feed her family. Ntsiki ran after him as her legs grew strong."},{"05":"Ma Monikazi had another baby boy, Velaphi, and another, Qudalele. Finally another sister, Nomyaleko. Little Ntsiki folded napkins and washed the baby clothes. She swept the house and fed the fire. She picked up her baby brother when he cried and tickled him till he laughed. She taught them to sing: “Be strong, little one. Winter is gone. Be brave, little one. Together we're strong!”"},{"06":"Qingqiwe, her grandfather, raised horses. His favourite was Shishi, a glossy black mare. As soon as Ntsiki was old enough, he hoisted her on to the saddle in front of him. His strong arms reached around her. He laced the reins through her fingers. He taught her to talk softly to Shishi, to groom her with a hard bristled brush. When she stroked its glossy coat, Albertina whispered, “You are the most beautiful creature. Thank you for letting me ride on your back.”"},{"07":"Her father, Bonilizwe, came home from the mines at Christmas. Ntsiki pulled herself up onto Shishi's broad back. She rode out to meet him at the bus stop. Ntsiki sat tall and straight. Her knees held firm. She handled the reins with gentle fingers. How proud Bonilizwe was of his daughter. The biggest smile Ntsiki had ever seen covered her father's face."},{"08":"On her sixth birthday she went to school. “You must choose an English name,” said the Presbyterian teacher, but Ntsiki liked her own name. “Why do I need a new name?” she asked. The teacher scowled and read the names aloud: “Adah, Agnes, Albertina, Anna.” What did they mean? Ntsiki liked the long name best. Al-ber-ti-na! The name had rhythm. Al-ber-ti-na! The name had bounce. Albertina was a name you didn't mess with."},{"09":"When her cousin married a handsome man from a nearby town, Albertina was chosen as an umkhapi. The maid of honour! Weeks before the wedding, she stitched her isikhakha, the short traditional skirt, and threaded bright beads onto her amatikiti. Her mother gave her the white flag and said, “You have a big job, my blessing.” At the bend in the road Albertina waved the flag, then turned Shishi back, leading everybody from miles around to the ceremony. People would gossip if she made a mistake, but the guests lined the road. They ululated and sang. They threw down flowers for the horse and the girl."},{"10":"Her mother was often sick and needed Albertina to look after the home. In her last year of primary school, Albertina was the oldest pupil in the school. She was chosen to be the head girl and wore her badge with pride. Her best friend, Betty, told her about a competition, saying, “You must apply, my clever friend.” “What is the prize?” asked Albertina, growing curious."},{"11":"“A scholarship to high school!” said Betty. “You must apply. You'll win it, for sure.” Albertina studied until the candle burned down. She practised sums. She practised spelling. She sharpened her pencils and gave her shoes an extra shine. Next morning she passed Shishi in her paddock. The horse whinnied and stamped the ground."},{"12":"The test began. Albertina's fingers shook. The sums were tricky. Her mouth went dry. Her hand cramped on her pencil but she continued. “Well done, Albertina!” said her teacher at the end. The important official arrived and called the top two students to the stage. “Well done to Albertina for full marks,” he said, “but you are too old. The scholarship goes to…”"},{"13":"Albertina tried not to cry. “That's unfair,” shouted Betty, hopping with fury. “That wasn't in the rules!” How would Albertina go to high school now? She dragged her feet all the way home. The teacher wrote to the newspaper about the unfair decision. Brother Joe at the Catholic Mission station read the story over his breakfast. He cracked his boiled egg with an extra flourish. He pushed the newspaper across the table to Father Bernard. He didn't like the story one bit either."},{"14":"Soon enough there was a scholarship for Albertina. Mariazell near Matatiele was a long way from Xolobe, but the whole village erupted. Their home girl was off to high school. She would make them proud. They threw a party like no other. The women brewed the sorghum beer and lit the fires. They slaughtered chickens and stirred up pots of meat. Albertina smiled till her face ached."},{"15":"She packed her brown suitcase and polished her shoes again. Before setting off on the bus to Matatiele, she said goodbye to Shishi. Albertina brushed her coat and stroked her wiry mane. She whispered all her questions into the horse's silky ear: What if I get lost? Will I make new friends? Will I still be clever so far from home? Shishi whinnied and stamped the ground."},{"16":"School days started well before sunrise. The girls washed quickly in the cold water and swept the dormitories before Mass. The milky porridge was never quite enough; the stew not as tasty as Aunty's back home. But Albertina studied hard. She played netball on sunny afternoons. In her school holidays Albertina worked at the mission station. She rubbed and scrubbed against the zinc washboard. She boiled sheets in copper tubs, then wound them through the wringer. She hoed and tilled the school garden but missed her family. Who was telling her brothers and sisters funny stories? Who wiped their eyes when they cried? Who tickled them until they laughed?"},{"17":"Albertina loved the nuns who taught her. Could she become a holy sister? “But nuns earn no salary,” said Father Bernard. “Perhaps you should become a nurse? You'll be paid while you study.”"},{"18":"Albertina took a train to Johannesburg. She bought a smart white uniform, new navy shoes and a shiny red fountain pen. Sick people came all day to the hospital. She cleaned their wounds with careful fingers. She held the old people gently. When the babies cried, she sang: “Be strong, little one. Winter's not long. Be brave, little one. Together we're strong!"},{"19":"Some nights Albertina worked till dawn. She looked out the window and thought of her family. Were the children hungry? Did they go to school? Who was riding Shishi? She remembered the dark green spinach. She missed the scent of the earth. There was no vegetable garden here. There was nowhere for a horse. Albertina never went to parties. She saved every shilling. On her days off she learned to play tennis. Whoosh! Plop! She whacked the ball across the net. Always, she wished for a little more money to send home."},{"20":"Walter Sisulu was a brave and clever man who dreamed of freedom for South Africa. His big smile captured Albertina's eye. They walked together down the city streets. Her delicate hand rested on his arm. Walter wanted Albertina to be the mother of his children."},{"21":"Bright ribbons decorated the Bantu Men's Social Centre on their wedding day. Albertina's long-sleeved dress had a swirling train of lace. Many friends blessed their special day. Albertina planted flowers in her little garden. Within a year, Max was born. Albertina had become a mother. One day people would call her the mother of the nation. Max had his mother's black button eyes and his father's round chin. He was the hope for their future. Albertina wanted to fight for a new South Africa, so that Max could be free. When he cried, she sang: “Be strong, little one. Winter's not long. Be brave, little one. Together we're strong!”"},{"22":"Police came in the middle of the night, banging on the door. Albertina scolded the men who messed up her house. “How rude you are!” she said, “trampling mud inside my home.”"},{"23":"In the morning Albertina's favourite flowers lay crushed beneath their footprints. She remembered chasing the chickens from her vegetable garden back in Xolobe and set about replanting her garden. The earth, she knew, would recover. She would support her husband who kept many secrets and hid from the police."},{"24":"She joined the women and worked to organise a march to Pretoria. The women refused to carry a pass. They sang, “Wathint' abafazi; wathint' imbokodo! You strike a woman; you strike a rock!” Many hard years followed after Walter's arrest. He was jailed on Robben Island for 26 years. Albertina, also, was sent to jail many times. Often she was scared. Often she was lonely."},{"25":"But even on the darkest nights, she could see a sliver of moon through the window in her cell. She sang the song that Ma Monikazi sang before she was born: “Be strong, little one. Winter's not long. Be brave, little one. Together we're strong!”"}]}]
