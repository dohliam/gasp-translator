The story appears in different versions in many southern African San communities. It warns foolish young men not to be confused by the outside appearance of a girl, and tells parents not to force their children to marry for the sake of domestic help. It also provokes the powerful presence of the hot sun in the desert and does what stories do â give everything in nature a personality. The illustrations in this story are from story boards by Marlene Winberg, interpreted digitally by Satsiri Winberg through manipulations of the Manyeka Art Collection of paintings made by San artists /Thaalu Rumao, /Tuoi Samcuia and Joao Wenne Dikuango, who have all passed away since."}]},{"i":"0103","t":"Singing the Truth: The Story of Miriam Makeba","a":"b|Jade Mathieson|Louwrisa Blaauw","s":[{"02":"A long time ago, in the vast city of Johannesburg, a baby girl was born.

Then he sat down to eat them up."},{"03":"Just as Anansi was about to put the first bite in his mouth, he heard a knock on his door. âOh, no!â thought Anansi. âWho can that be?â But he opened the door. There was Turtle, who looked very tired. Turtle said, âAnansi, please let me in. I've walked so far today, and I'm so tired and hungry.â So what could Anansi do but let him in?"},{"04":"Anansi was too selfish to share his beautiful delicious yams with anybody else. So he came up with a nasty plan. Just as Turtle sat down at the table and began to reach for some yams, Anansi yelled at him, âTurtle, your hands are all dirty! You can't eat with your hands all dirty! Go wash them.â Turtle's hands really were dirty. So he slowly crawled to the river, washed his hands, and then crawled back."},{"05":"But meanwhile Anansi had started gobbling up the yams. By the time Turtle got back, he saw that the yams were all gone. Turtle looked at Anansi. âThank you for inviting me to dinner. If you're ever near my house, please come by and let me return the favour,â said Turtle. And Turtle began crawling slowly away to his house."},{"06":"As time went by, Anansi began to think more and more about how Turtle had promised to feed him a free dinner. So one day he walked over to Turtle's house. Anansi got to Turtle's house just about dinnertime, as the sun was going down over the river. Turtle was lying on a rock in the sun, warming himself up, as turtles do. When Turtle saw Anansi, he said, âHello there, Anansi, have you come to have dinner with me?â And Anansi said, âYes, that would be very nice, thank you.â He was getting hungrier and hungrier."},{"07":"So Turtle dived down to the bottom of the river to set the table for dinner and get everything ready. Anansi waited on the rocks by the shore. Soon Turtle swam back up and said, âOh Anansi, it is all ready now, please join me for dinner.â And Turtle dived down again and began to eat the green leaves he had for dinner."},{"08":"Anansi tried to dive down to the bottom of the river, but he was a spider, not a turtle, and he couldn't dive that deep. He kept floating back up to the surface again. He tried jumping in, he tried diving in, but nothing helped. He just couldn't get down to that dinner."},{"09":"Finally Anansi had an idea. He put lots of stones in the pockets of his coat, and finally he was heavy enough to sink down to the bottom of the river. How clever he was! He saw Turtle's table, full of juicy green leaves and lots of other delicious food. Anansi's mouth was watering."},{"10":"But just as Anansi was reaching for some of that delicious food, Turtle stopped him. âAnansi, surely you're not going to eat dinner with your coat on? That's not how we do things at my house.â Anansi, without thinking, said, âOh, of course you're right, Turtle, what was I thinking?â He took off his coat."},{"11":"But without the rocks in his pockets to hold him down, Anansi floated right back to the surface of the river again, and popped out of the water. Anansi sadly put his head down into the water and watched Turtle eat up all of the delicious food!"}]},{"i":"0272","t":"Lion's fire sticks","a":"b|Traditional San story|Manyeka Arts Trust","s":[{"02":"This story starts in the old times when animals and people lived together.

They decided to wait until evening and started singing and singing, clapping and clapping, calling everyone together. âCome dance with us. Come dance with us. Come dance with us.â"},{"04":"Many animals came from the bush to join in the dancing and singing. Lion brought his fire sticks. He rubbed the sticks, rubbed and rubbed.

Soon everyone was dancing around a fire."},{"05":"Rabbit was a cunning and fast animal. The people said to him, âWhile we are singing here and while Lion is dancing with us, you must take his fire sticks and run.â So Rabbit grabbed Lion's fire sticks and ran. He did not make it because Lion caught up with him and brought the fire sticks back."},{"06":"The lion sang a boastful song: âTo me it does not matter. I don't have a problem. I can eat you with hair, I can eat you without hair. I don't have a problem. All of you are food to me.â"},{"07":"Springbok could run and jump very fast. The people said to him, âWhile Lion is dancing and singing here with us, you must grab his fire sticks and run.â"},{"08":"When they were dancing and singing, Springbok grabbed the fire sticks and jumped away into the veld. But Lion said, âWhy do I not hear the clippety-clop clippety-clop of Springbok's hooves behind me?â"},{"09":"Lion turned and saw Springbok running into the veld with his fire sticks. So he ran after Springbok, caught him and came back with his fire sticks. Again, Lion sang his boastful song."},{"10":"Then the people whispered to each other. They said, âLet us ask Duiker. He is small and very fast.â âDuiker,â they said, âwhile Lion is dancing and singing here with us, you must grab his fire sticks and run away.â"},{"11":"When they were dancing around the fire, Duiker grabbed Lion's fire sticks and ran into the veld. But Lion said, âWhy do I not hear Duiker snort-snorting behind me as before?â He turned around and chased after little Duiker who was leaping into the veld. Lion caught up with him and returned to the fire with his sticks."},{"12":"Again, Lion sang his boastful song. âTo me it does not matter. I don't have a problem. I can eat you with hair, I can eat you without hair. I don't have a problem. All of you are food to me.â"},{"13":"âOh,â sighed the people, âWhich animal can help us now? Ostrich has the longest legs of all, let us ask him.â They explained the plan to Ostrich and he grabbed Lion's fire sticks this time."},{"14":"Lion said, âWhy do I not hear Ostrich's high singing voice behind me anymore?â He looked around, saw Ostrich and chased after him."},{"15":"After a long time, Lion returned with a tired face, for Ostrich ran too fast for him. âFrom this day on,â he said, âI will not leave any of you alone. I will hunt you and chase you and eat you!â And this is how Lion came to be everyone's enemy and how people got the power of fire."}]},{"i":"0019","t":"My first day at the market","a":"b|Timothy Kabare,Ursula Nafula|Catherine Groenewald","s":[{"02":"I live in Kakuma village, a very hot dry place, full of thorny trees, and more goats than people.

He was furiously scratching at the side of the pit, but he couldn't get out."},{"06":"\"Oh let me help you, my dear friend!\" said Anansi. \"Just lie down on these sticks and I'll pull you out.\" Anansi wound his sticky web round the leopard and the sticks, and pulled him up to heaven to show the Sky God. But Nyame just laughed and said, \"Where are the other two?\""},{"07":"So Anansi went back down to earth to get the second creature. He thought and he thought and he came up with a plan. He took a gourd full of water and went to the tree where the hornets lived. He poured out some of the water all over their nest. Then he cut a leaf from a banana tree and held it over his head, and he poured the rest of the water all over himself."},{"08":"He called out to the hornets, \"Hey hornets! Come see! It is raining! Quick - get inside my gourd and it will keep all of you dry.\" Hornets don't like to get wet, so they all flew into Anansi's gourd."},{"09":"Then Anansi quickly spun a web across the opening so the hornets couldn't get out no matter how much they buzzed. He carried them up to heaven and showed them to the Sky God. But Nyame just said, \"Where's the last one?\" (He wasn't laughing so much anymore.)"},{"10":"So Anansi went down to earth again. He thought and thought and he thought, but he couldn't come up with a plan. So he asked his wife, who had a very good idea. Together they found a good long thick branch and some strong vines. When they got near the stream where the snake lived, they began to argue. \"The branch is longer!\" \"No, it isn't!\" \"Yes it is!\""},{"11":"Soon the snake came out and asked what the argument was. \"I was arguing with my wife,\" said Anansi. \"She says this stick is longer than you are. But I don't agree.\" \"Of course I'm longer than that stick!\" said the snake. \"I'm very long! I'm a huge snake! Just put your stick next to me and measure!\""},{"12":"So Anansi did that, and he tied the snake to the stick with his vine to keep him straight. When he was all tied up, Anansi took the snake up to heaven."},{"13":"Nyame had to admit that Anansi had paid his price. So he went to his wooden box, opened the lid, and gave all the stories to Anansi. Anansi carried the stories triumphantly down to earth.

Then they flew back with the figs for themselves and their relatives. The sight of so many figs made Anansi's mouth water. How could he get them for himself?"},{"03":"He thought of a plan. He carefully covered his bottom with sticky beeswax. Then he took a piece of clay pot and went to see the crows. âPlease could you help me?â he asked. âI need a live coal to get my fire going again.â As they were getting the coal from the fire, Anansi carefully sat firmly on one of the largest figs, so that it would stick to his bottom. He thanked the crows, and hurried home to enjoy the fig."},{"04":"But one fig wasn't enough for him. He went back a second time, and did the same. When he went back a third time, the crows began to get suspicious. âWhy do you keep coming back to us to get a coal?â they said. Anansi answered, âEvery time when I get home, the coal has burnt out.â âYou're lying!â said the crows. âYou just want our food!â âThat's not true,â said Anansi. And he started crying."},{"05":"The crows felt sorry for him. The next morning at first light, each crow gave him a feather. He flew with them to the fig tree in the middle of the wide river. When he saw the luscious figs, Anansi wanted them all for himself. Each time a crow tried to pick a fig, he shouted out, âThat one is mine! I saw it first!â And then he took the fig and put it into his bag. Eventually he had all the figs and the crows had none."},{"06":"He was left all alone as the darkness began to fall. âIf I don't want to stay in this tree for the rest of my life,â he said to himself, âI'll just have to jump into the air like the crowsâ. So he took a deep breath, jumped, andâ¦PLOP!

You're the first of my relatives I've ever met!â He cried so much that the crocodiles felt sorry for him."},{"08":"The oldest crocodile said, âWe'll know you're one of us if you can eat and enjoy mud soup just like we do.â They gave him a pot of dirty brown water. âJust like my grandmother used to make it!â Anansi said. But he made a hole in the ground with his back foot, and a hole in the pot with his front foot. As he pretended to drink the soup, it oozed down through the pot into the hole beneath his feet."},{"09":"âDelicious!â he exclaimed, giving back the empty pot. âNow we know you are definitely one of us,â the crocodiles said.

They had two children, Mukhwana and Namono. There was a famine in the land where they lived. All the villagers, including Mulongo and his family, would leave their homes early to look for food in the forest."},{"03":"One day, Mulongo, his wife and children decided to go deep in the forest in search of something to eat. From morning to evening they looked for food but they found nothing. Nambuya urged her husband to go further into the forest. Mulongo led the way as Nambuya and the two children followed."},{"04":"Suddenly Mulongo saw a beautiful banana plantation. He called his wife and said, âIs that not a banana plantation? I can see bananas and other food crops. I wonder whose it is.â They moved on and soon saw a house in the middle of the plantation. They stopped, looked in all directions, but there was no one around. Because they were hungry and it was nearly night time, they decided to sit and wait for the owner."},{"05":"Suddenly they heard heavy breathing close to the house. They were frightened to see a huge ogre arrive. âWho are you and what do you want?â asked the ogre in a fearful voice. Mulongo in a trembling voice said, âWe came looking for food because there is famine in our place.â The ogre gave them food."},{"06":"For several days the ogre allowed Mulongo and his family to eat his crops without asking for anything in return. One morning, however, the ogre said to Nambuya, âI want you to cook your son for me to eat when I come back this evening.â When the ogre had gone Mulongo went into the bush and killed some small animals, which he asked his wife to cook for the ogre. Meanwhile he asked Mukhwana to climb up a leafy mango tree and hide."},{"07":"In the evening the ogre returned and asked, âHave you cooked Mukhwana for me?â Mulongo's wife answered, âYes.â She gave the ogre the meat and he greedily ate everything. Then he said, âTomorrow you cook your daughter.â"},{"08":"The following morning Mulongo and his wife did as they had done on the first day. Namono was hidden up the mango tree. When the ogre returned he said, âDid you cook Namono?â Again, Nambuya told the ogre that she had done so."},{"09":"After eating, the ogre instructed Nambuya to cook her husband Mulongo, the next day. Nambuya was perturbed but Mulongo said he would go out again and catch some animals to cook. He did that and after giving the meat to his wife, he also climbed up the mango tree to hide."},{"10":"At dusk the ogre came back. Nambuya gave the meat to the ogre who enjoyed it very much. He told Nambuya, âTomorrow cook yourself.â When the ogre had left Nambuya called her husband to advise her. Mulongo said, âGo and look for some small animals and cook them for the ogre. When everything is ready, come up the tree where we are.â"},{"11":"The ogre came back in the afternoon and started eating his tasty evening meal of sweet meat. He felt sleepy, went to lie under the mango tree and began snoring. But not so long after, the ogre woke up because he heard noises above him. The ogre looked up to the tree and saw Mulongo and his wife and children."},{"12":"The ogre was very angry. âSo you deceived me? Let me come and get you,â he shouted. As the ogre was struggling to climb up the tree, Mulongo quickly thought of a trick and said, âIt will be easier for you to reach us if you tie a rope around your neck and we help to pull you up.â"},{"13":"The ogre ran into the house, brought a strong rope and after tying it around his neck he threw the other end of the rope to Mulongo. Mulongo and his wife and children started pulling the ogre up as they twisted the rope. The rope soon tightened around the ogre's neck until he could not breathe and died. Mulongo and his family came down the tree and took over the ogre's house and property."}]},{"i":"0308","t":"The Honeyguide's revenge","a":"b|Zulu folktale|Wiehan de Jager","s":[{"02":"This is the story of Togar, the Honeyguide, and a greedy young man named Gartee.

He began climbing, holding the cool end of the smoking stick in his teeth."},{"05":"Soon he could hear the loud buzzing of the busy bees. They were coming in and out of a hollow in the tree trunk â their hive. When Gartee reached the hive he pushed the smoking end of the stick into the hollow.

They flew away because they didn't like the smoke â but not before they had given Gartee some painful stings!"},{"06":"When the bees were out, Gartee pushed his hands into the nest.

He put the comb carefully in the pouch he carried on his shoulder, and started to climb down the tree."},{"07":"Togar eagerly watched everything that Gartee was doing. He was waiting for him to leave a fat piece of honeycomb as a thank-you offering to the Honeyguide. Togar flittered from branch to branch, closer and closer to the ground. Finally Gartee reached the bottom of the tree. Togar perched on a rock near the boy and waited for his reward."},{"08":"But, Gartee put out the fire, picked up his spear and started walking home, ignoring the bird. Togar called out angrily, \"VIC-torr! VIC-torrr!\" Gartee stopped, stared at the little bird and laughed aloud. \"You want some honey, do you, my friend? Ha! But I did all the work, and got all the stings. Why should I share any of this lovely honey with you?\" Then he walked off. Togar was furious! This was no way to treat him! But he would get his revenge."},{"09":"One day several weeks later Gartee again heard the honey call of the Honeyguide, Togar. He remembered the delicious honey, and eagerly followed the bird once again. After leading Gartee along the edge of the forest, Togar stopped to rest in a great umbrella thorn. \"Ahh,\" thought Gartee. \"The hive must be in this tree.\" He quickly made his small fire and began to climb, the smoking branch in his teeth. Togar sat and watched."},{"10":"Gartee climbed, wondering why he didn't hear the usual buzzing. \"Perhaps the hive is deep in the tree,\" he thought to himself. He pulled himself up another branch. But instead of the hive, he was staring into the face of a leopard! Leopard was very angry at having her sleep so rudely interrupted. She narrowed her eyes, opened her mouth to reveal her very large and very sharp teeth."},{"11":"Before Leopard could take a swipe at Gartee, he rushed down the tree. In his hurry he missed a branch, and landed with a heavy thud on the ground twisting his ankle. He hobbled off as fast as he could. Luckily for him, Leopard was still too sleepy to chase him. Togar, the Honeyguide, had his revenge. And Gartee learned his lesson."},{"12":"And so, when the children of Gartee hear the story of Togar they have respect for the little bird.

He pulled and pulled to free himself from the trap. The trap got tighter and tighter around his leg every time he pulled. Lion grew tired and he felt more pain in his leg. Finally, he gave up."},{"04":"Days went past as Lion sat baking in the sun. He was hungry and thirsty and there was nobody to save him. He became weaker and weaker. âI am going to die of hunger and thirst in this trap,â he thought to himself."},{"05":"One morning, Lion heard a sound coming from the nearby bushes. He listened and looked closer. He saw Warthog walking with his wife and children, talking and laughing. The Warthog family were going to the river to drink water and play in the mud before the sun got too hot."},{"06":"âWarthog! Please help me! Warthog!â cried Lion. âPlease set me free from this trap,â pleaded Lion. âNever,â said Warthog. âYou are a cruel animal.

The boy nodded and so the old woman allowed him to go into the forest."},{"11":"The boy ran off, but before he could enter the forest, he heard a voice saying, âBoy! Come back here!â He started to be confused about what the old woman wanted. He ran back to her. She said, âI don't think you heard me properly. I said you will find many wonderful things in the forest, but don't take any of these things. Only bring back the root that you find.â The boy nodded and ran back to the forest."},{"12":"Just after he had entered the forest, he heard a voice again saying, âBoy! Come back here!â He tried to ignore the voice but he continued hearing it so he went back to the old woman. The old woman said, âI don't trust you. I don't think you'll do what I ask you to do.

The people who lived there had been happy before, but then wild animals had come and had begun to frighten them. These animals ate all their crops and from time to time they even carried off children who wandered away from their parents. It was not a good place to live any longer, and the people began to think of where they might go to lead a new life."},{"03":""},{"04":"One family found the answer. Rather than deal with the wild animals who seemed to be everywhere on the flat land, they decided to go in search of food up in the hills. It was not hard to find food there. There were bushes that grew in the cracks between rocks. There were trees that grew at the foot of the slopes. There were rock rabbits which could be trapped and birds which could be brought down with the stones which littered the floor of the caves."},{"05":""},{"06":"Other families noticed how well the hill family was doing. They saw the sleekness of their children, and they noticed how calm the parents were. âIt is a good life that we lead up in the hills,â said the husband. âYou should come there too.â Soon the other families abandoned their homes on the flat land and went up to the hills. Each family found a cave to live in, and in this way they were warm and secure. Soon everybody talked about how sorry they were that they had not come to the hills earlier, rather than letting the wild animals eat their crops and drag off their children."},{"07":""},{"08":"As the children grew up in the hills, they began to get better at the things that had to be done to live in such a place. They became very quick at climbing rocks, and even the youngest could scamper up a face of rock almost as quickly as any rock rabbit. They also became good at climbing into trees to look for fruit, and they could swing in the branches almost as well as any monkey. People who passed by and saw the hill people living on their hill wondered whether they were perhaps wild animals, but when they saw their faces and the clothes that they were wearing they realised that they were only people who had made the hills their home."},{"09":""},{"10":"Slowly, things began to change. The parents noticed that their children were talking less, and that rather than speaking to one another in the language of people they were beginning to use grunts. Then the adults themselves noticed that their noses were getting bigger and that they were growing hairier. Every time they looked at one another they saw that their faces had changed yet more and that their teeth were longer. Soon they spent as much time on four legs as on two, and it was at this point that they became a new creature. This creature, which had never before been seen in that place, was the creature which people now call the baboon."},{"11":""},{"12":"For a time, the baboons lived happily. They stopped chasing the rock rabbits and started to eat grubs from the ground. They also forgot how to talk, and nobody now made any sound other than a bark or a grunt. They took off their clothes and let the rags lie on the ground until they were destroyed by ants. Their legs and arms were now completely covered with dark hair. They still remembered, though, that they had been people, and this was something which made them worried. When they looked into each other's faces, they realised that their noses were now much bigger than they had been before, and this made them jeer. Every baboon laughed at every other baboon, pointing at his enlarged nose and throwing his hands about in mirth. This made the baboon who was being laughed at angry. He would jump up and down in anger, all the while laughing at the large nose of the other."},{"13":""},{"14":"Eventually the mockery became so great that the baboons could no longer bear to be together. Each family split off and lived by itself, laughing at the others because of their great noses, but not liking to be laughed at for their own noses.

Her parents' next child was a boy. Her parents, big sisters and younger brother all called her Bassie for short."},{"03":"When she was a child, Bassie was very shy. She liked to sing and dance in her room on her own. One day at school netball practice, the coach told two girls to pick teams.

One that is very close to her heart is the Nelson Mandela Institute."},{"10":"Bassie had a very close relationship with Nelson Mandela.

But the imbulu answered, \"Let me wear them until we get to that tree.\" She pointed to a tree on the hill."},{"09":"When they reached the tree, Nonkungu said to the imbulu, \"Please give me back my skirt and beads.\" \"Just let me wear them until we get to the next stream,\" said the imbulu. Nonkungu was afraid, so she agreed."},{"10":"At last they reached the stream. Again Nonkungu asked the imbulu, \"Please give me back my skirt and my beads.\" \"Just let me wear them until we get to that hut where the women are sitting,\" said the imbulu. So they walked on."},{"11":"When they reached the hut, the imbulu pushed Nonkungu back and called to the women sitting by the hut. \"Look at this girl wearing rags. She has been following me all day. I wish she would go away,\" said the imbulu. Nonkungu was so ashamed and so frightened that she ran hid in the kraal."},{"12":"Then the imbulu went to Uncle Mtonyama's hut. She said sweetly, \"I am your niece, Nonkungu. My parents sent me to stay with you.\" Mtonyama welcomed the young girl. He and his family were very kind to the imbulu. But poor Nonkungu had to sleep in the kraal and share the dog's food."},{"13":"During the day Nonkungu went to the fields, hid in the corn, and sang: \"Oh misery me, misery me. I was sent by my father and mother to stay with my Uncle Mtonyama. On the way I met an imbulu and she took my skirt and my beads. Oh misery me, misery me.\""},{"14":"One day, one of Mtonyama's brothers was walking in the fields. He heard the strange and beautiful song. He didn't know who was singing, but when he got home, he told Mtonyama the words. Mtonyama went into the fields. He heard the song, and looked until he found Nonkungu."},{"15":"Nonkungu told him what had happened, how the imbulu had taken her beautiful clothes. Mtonyama took her back to his place and hid her in a hut. Mtonyama knew what he was going to do to catch the imbulu."},{"16":"Mtonyama had heard that an imbulu's tail loves milk and that it can't go past milk without drinking some. So he told his men to dig a deep ditch and to fill the ditch with sour milk. Then he called all the girls of the village to take part in a jumping competition."},{"17":"The imbulu was worried. She did not want to jump over the ditch. She knew that her tail would be thirsty for the sour milk. So she went into a hut and tied her tail to her body as tightly as she could. Then she took her place with the other girls."},{"18":"One girl after another jumped over the ditch. At last it was the imbulu's turn. She tried to jump high over the ditch, but her tail broke loose. The imbulu's tail pulled her down, down, down into the sour milk."},{"19":"As the imbulu struggled in the sour milk, the men quickly filled the ditch with sand and buried her. That was the end of the imbulu. Nonkungu stayed happily with her uncle for a long, long time. And that is the end of the story."}]},{"i":"0097","t":"Silly Sizwe","a":"b|Val Morris|Felicity Bell","s":[{"02":"Once, long ago, there was a boy called Sizwe who lived with his mother near to the Chief's kraal.

He was asked to collect all the eggs, which the hens had laid all around the kraal."},{"05":"All day Sizwe looked for eggs, and when it was time to go home, he was given some eggs to take to his mother. He was very happy as he ran off with the eggs in his hands. But just as he passed the Chief's house, he tripped over a stone and dropped the eggs.  The Chief's daughter watched as he tried to catch them before they fell on the ground. He looked very funny, but the girl did not even smile."},{"06":"When he got home, he told his mother what had happened. âYou silly boy,â said his mother. âYou should have put the eggs in your hat and you could have brought them safely home.â âNever mind Mother,â said Sizwe. âI will do that next time.â"},{"07":"The next day, Sizwe was asked to milk the Chief's cows. When he had finished milking at the end of the day, he was given a bucket of milk to take home to his mother. Just as he got to the Chief's house, he remembered that the bucket belonged to the Chief. So he poured the milk into his hat. Then Sizwe put his hat on again."},{"08":"Woosh! The milk splashed all over him. He looked very funny, as the milk ran down his face and clothes. The Chief's daughter saw what happened, but she never even smiled."},{"09":"âYou silly child,â said his mother, âIf you had carried the bucket in your hand, you could have brought the milk safely home.â âNever mind Mother,â said Sizwe. âI will remember to do that next time.â"},{"10":"The next day, Sizwe had to look after the Chief's pigs. He worked very hard feeding the pigs. When the work was done, he was given a little piglet to take home. Remembering what his mother had said, he tried to carry the piglet in his hands. But the piglet wriggled and wriggled, until it wriggled out of his hands. Sizwe tried to catch it, but he fell in the mud."},{"11":"The Chief's daughter saw Sizwe fall in the mud, but she did not laugh. She never even smiled. His mother was very cross with Sizwe when he told her what had happened. âYou stupid boy,â she said, âyou should have held the rope and pulled the piglet behind you.â âNever mind Mother. I will do that next time,â said Sizwe."},{"12":"The next day, Sizwe had to work in the Chief's kitchen. He worked hard all day washing the dishes. When all the work was done, the cook gave Sizwe a big fish to take home.  Sizwe was very happy with the fish, and remembering what his mother had said, he tied a rope to the fish and went off home, pulling it behind him."},{"13":"The chief's cats smelled the fish and came running out of the houses to get a bit of fish. Soon they had eaten all the fish. By the time he got to the Chief's house, all he was pulling was the fish bones. Did the chief's daughter laugh? No, she did not even smile."},{"14":"âYou silly, silly boy,â said his mother when she told her what had happened. You should have carried it on your shoulder.â âDon't worry,â said Sizwe, âI will do so next time.â"},{"15":"The next day when Sizwe got to work, he had to clean the cow's kraal. He worked hard all day. At the end of the day, he was given one of the Chief's cows to take to his mother. Sizwe was very happy. He remembered his mother's words, âCarry it home on your shoulder.â"},{"16":"Sizwe got down on his hands and knees under the cow. then he pushed and pushed until at last he had the cow on his shoulders. As he staggered past the Chief's house, the daughter saw Sizwe. He looked so funny! And do you know what happened? She laughed and laughed and laughed."},{"17":"The Chief was so happy to hear his daughter laugh, that he called Sizwe into his house and told him that because he had made his daughter laugh, Sizwe and his mother should live in the kraal. So Sizwe and his mother went to live in the Chief's kraal. Everybody lived happily ever after."}]},{"i":"0036","t":"Miss Helen's Magical World","a":"b|Jacqui L'ange|Wendy Morison","s":[{"02":"Meet my friend Helen. She was born in a little Karoo town called Nieu Bethesda. There was not much going on in this town. But she made a whole world here. She even made me. And she named her house after me. It was called âThe Owl House'."},{"03":"Most of Helen's nine brothers and sisters were grown up and gone by the time she arrived. But she still had her sisters Annie and Alida. Helen didn't have many friends in the village, but she didn't mind. From the start, Helen did things differently from most people."},{"04":"After her sisters left home, Helen lived alone with her parents. She loved her mother, but she hated her father. Everyone agreed he was a very strange man. Her big sister Alida travelled all over the world. One day she sent Helen a postcard from Egypt. In her mind Helen saw princes and pyramids and camels in the sand."},{"05":"As she grew older, Helen read more stories of faraway places. She especially liked poems from Persia in the Middle East. She dreamed of visiting the ocean one day. She kept a seashell on her bedside table, and imagined she could hear the sound of waves inside it. But of course, owls were always her favourite things of all!"},{"06":"Helen loved books and stories so much that she decided to become a teacher. She was very good at it too. But then she met Johannes Pienaar. He was also a teacher, and a writer and actor. He convinced her to run away with him."},{"07":"Helen and Johannes got married. They travelled to many different towns, teaching and performing plays. Helen thought she might start a family like her sisters had done. But it was not to be. She and her husband were always fighting. When Helen's mother became very sick, she decided it was time to go back home."},{"08":"Helen was not happy. Her mother was so sick, and her father was so grumpy. She kept to herself. People thought she was strange. The night her mother died, Helen kept a candle burning beside her bed all night. With the help of that little light, Helen didn't feel so afraid of the dark. And remember, we owls were there too. We watched over her, calling woowooh!"},{"09":"Helen decided she wanted brightness in her life. She began by changing the space around her. She needed helpers. Three men from the village, Jonas Adams, Piet van der Merwe, and Koos Malgas, made the things she imagined out of wire and cement. She filled her back garden with interesting creatures. There were sphinxes and camels, mermaids and cats. And lots and lots of owls! She called it her camel yard. On the fence she made a wire sign. It said: \"This is my world.\""},{"10":"During the day Helen made sculptures. At night, she practised catching light. She collected glasses and mirrors, candles and lamps. Anything that would shine. She put lanterns in every room. Mirrors caught and reflected the light. She covered the walls in glittering glass so that they could shine too. After Helen's father died, she had the house to herself. Each night she slept in a different room. She would always choose the one with the best view of the moon and the stars."},{"11":"The people of Nieu Bethesda would walk past Helen's garden and marvel at the creatures in it. Some of the village children brought her glass bottles for her sculptures and called her \"Miss Helen.\" She always thanked them with sweets. Others were not so friendly. They called her names and threw stones on her roof. Miss Helen spent all her money on glass and cement. She lived on bread and black tea. In her diary she wrote: \"In my loneliness I am happy.\""},{"12":"The garden grew and grew, until there was hardly space left for any more creatures. Miss Helen was tired now. Her hands were stiff and sore. Her eyes were going blind from working with tiny bits of glass. She wasn't afraid of being alone. But she was still afraid of the dark. And her world was getting darker and darker. She knew that soon she wouldn't be able to see anything at all."},{"13":"But when she closed her eyes for the last time, Miss Helen didn't see darkness. She saw the sun and the moon and the stars. She saw wise men and mermaids, camels and cats, acrobats and owls with big brown glittering glass eyes.

He lived in a palace with the queen and their daughter, princess Apenyo. Princess Apenyo was such a beautiful young woman that every man wanted to marry her. But king Kayanja demanded a very high bride price for the princess."},{"03":"Near king Kayanja's palace lived a chief called Aludah the Great. He was called âthe Greatâ because everybody in the neighbourhood obeyed him. (He was very violent to anyone who disobeyed him!) Chief Aludah's wife had recently died of malaria and he wanted another wife."},{"04":"So the fat old chief went to king Kayanja to offer bride wealth for the young princess. While the two men were discussing the price, the maid Kakembo overheard their conversation. Maid Kakembo was very close to princess Apenyo."},{"05":"Chief Aludah agreed to give half of his wealth to king Kayanja, including a needle, which was also part of the bride price. Preparations were made in secret for the wedding between chief Aludah and princess Apenyo. The king knew that his daughter would not be happy with this decision."},{"06":"One week before the royal wedding day, maid Kakembo approached Apenyo. âMy dear princess, your father has organised your wedding with Chief Aludah, and it will take place in one week,â said Kakembo."},{"07":"Princess Apenyo was shocked and at first didn't know what to do. Then she thought, âI will never marry chief Aludah, that fat old man. Never! I must hurry to Trevor and see what he can do before it's too late.â Trevor was princess Apenyo's boyfriend."},{"08":"That night Apenyo crept out of the palace. If her father discovered where she was going he would be very angry. She ran through the thick, dark forest over rocks and shrubs, until she finally reached her Trevor. When she arrived at his house she was tired, hungry, and thirsty."},{"09":"âMy love, why have you run all this long distance alone and at such a time of night?â asked Trevor. He fetched drinking water for her and allowed her to rest. Trevor could not settle down while he waited for Apenyo to talk."},{"10":"âMy dear princess, what is the problem?â asked Trevor. Apenyo breathed heavily and said sadly, âMy father wants to marry me off to chief Aludah the Great. But I can't marry that horrible man. Trevor, I want to marry you even if you are poor. I am ready to suffer. I love you.â"},{"11":"âBut princess, I have nothing to pay as your bride price, you know I'm a poor boy.â cried Trevor. Apenyo replied, âI know, but it's only you I can get married to.â She thought for a while and said, âLet's go to Kategga the boat man to sail us to the other side of the river. That way we can escape and my father will never find us.â"},{"12":"Back at the palace, king Kayanja had discovered Princess Apenyo's disappearance and ordered his subjects to search for her everywhere in the village. The king's guards, soldiers, and everyone else searched, but they couldn't find Princess Apenyo. They went back to the King and told him Apenyo was nowhere to be seen. âThen go to the bush and search,â King Kayanja ordered. He was very annoyed."},{"13":"As Princess Apenyo and Trevor hurried to the riverbank, dark clouds began gathering in the sky. A heavy storm was coming."},{"14":"Kategga the boatman was mooring his boat when the young couple approached him. Trevor asked Kategga to row them across the river. Kategga refused to accept, explaining that a heavy storm was fast approaching, and it would be too dangerous."},{"15":"Trevor insisted and explained to Kategga why they must cross. He then put his hand deep in his pocket and took out a cowrie shell to give to Kategga. When Kategga heard their story and saw the beautiful shell, he felt sorry for them. He agreed to row them across the river in spite of the weather."},{"16":"Kategga pulled the boat near the bank and told them to get in. He then picked his oars and began rowing. When king Kayanja and chief Aludah reached the bank, they saw the three people in the boat. They realised that the young lovers had escaped."},{"17":"Heavy winds rocked the boat and Kategga could no longer control it. King Kayanja shouted: âApenyo, please come back! I have forgiven you and will never punish you or Trevor.â But it was too late. The boat tipped over and the three people were thrown into the wild water. They all drowned. After that day, everyone in king Kayanja's kingdom could marry anyone they wanted, rich or poor."}]},{"i":"0118","t":"Tselane and the giant","a":"b|Lorato Trok|Catherine Groenewald","s":[{"02":"Once upon a time there was a little girl called Tselane.

Her mother was scared to leave her alone because this village was known to have many giants living in caves nearby. But Tselane cried so much that her mother gave in and agreed that she could stay behind."},{"04":"Tselane's mother said that she would bring her food every day. âI will sing a song and you will know that it's me. Don't open the door for anyone else, my child,â said Tselane's mother."},{"05":"Tselane my child! Tselane my child! Come out and eat your porridge! Come out and eat your porridge! Tselane ngwanaka!

You are not my mother!â said Tselane.âYou are a giant!â The giant walked away disappointed and disappeared into the caves."},{"09":"Every morning and every evening, Tselane's mother brought her food. Every morning and every evening, the giant also came. But each time Tselane sent him away. She recognised his deep voice as he tried to sing her mother's song."},{"10":"One day the giant came up with an idea: âI can change my voice to resemble that of Tselane's mother!â He made a big fire and threw a round smooth stone into the fire. When the stone was very hot and red, he took it out of the fire and swallowed it! âKudutlu!â went the hot stone through the throat of the giant."},{"11":"The giant started singing to hear if his voice had changed. He jumped for joy when he heard his voice sounding as sweet as that of Tselane's mother!"},{"12":"Early the next day, the giant went to Tselane's house very early in the morning. When he got to the door of the house, he started singing: Tselane my child! Tselane my child! Come out and eat your porridge! Come out and eat your porridge! Tselane ngwanaka! Tselane ngwanaka! Tla o tseye bogobe o je. Tla o tseye bogobe o je!"},{"13":"Tselane was excited to hear her mother's sweet voice. She opened the door, and there was the giant! She tried to close the door but the giant was too quick. He grabbed Tselane and threw her into a sack."},{"14":"The giant walked back to his cave, singing and happy. âIf only I had traditional beer, it would go so well with my dinner tonight. What a beautiful day!â he said to himself."},{"15":"A little later in the morning, Tselane's mother came as usual to bring her daughter food. She sang her song, but Tselane did not come out. She sang her song again, but still Tselane did not come out. After singing for the third time, she kicked the door open. Tselane was nowhere to be found. She knew what had happened, and she quickly thought of a plan."},{"16":"She poured some beer into a big calabash, put it on her head, walked down to the caves and knocked on the giant's door. The giant smelled the delicious smell of traditional beer and opened the door quickly. âGood evening, giant!â said Tselane's mother. âI was passing through and I heard you singing beautifully. I am going to another village for a child's birthday party.â"},{"17":"The giant was not going to let the opportunity of drinking traditional beer pass him by! He invited Tselane's mother into his cave. âLet me pour you some beer before I get back on the road,â said Tselane's mother. The giant was very happy and drank the beer in one gulp."},{"18":"Tselane's mother gave him more and more - and more - until the calabash was empty. By now the giant was so drunk that he fell asleep on the floor."},{"19":"When Tselane's mother heard the giant's loud snores, she opened the sack and out jumped Tselane.

They were beaten with long sticks, and given thin porridge only once a day for food. So they ran away."},{"03":"They found a cave to live in. They were scared because they had heard that there were cannibals living in the hills. So they made a strong door to cover the entrance, with only two holes to let in air and light. Demane warned his sister, âStay in the cave while I am out hunting, and don't cook any meat. Cannibals love the smell of cooking meat.â"},{"04":"Each evening Demane brought back something he had killed â a hare or some birds or a small buck.

It has two holes.â"},{"05":"Demazane found it very boring to stay in the cave all day. So one day, when her brother had gone, she went out to explore. She found a stream to play in, and some trees to climb. She felt free and happy. âPerhaps,â she thought, âthere are no cannibals. Perhaps Uncle said there were cannibals just to frighten us.â"},{"06":"The next day she felt bold enough to make a fire to warm herself. But she made it inside the cave with the door firmly shut â just to be on the safe side. âI'm sure it won't matter if I put a little meat on the fire. It will be so good to have a cooked meal.â"},{"07":"When her brother came home he sang as usual, âDemazane, Demazane, child of my mother, open this cave to me. The swallows can enter it. It has two holes.â She opened the door and let him in. When he saw the cooked meat, Demane asked, âHow did you do this without a fire?â âI dried the meat in the sun outside the cave,â Demazane replied quickly. Demane was too tired to argue, and they sat down to enjoy the meal together."},{"08":"The next day, she made a fire and cooked meat again. She had just finished when a voice sang outside the door, âDemazane, Demazane, child of my mother, open this cave to me. The swallows can enter it. It has two holes.â But the voice did not sound like her brother's. Demazane said, âNo. You are not my brother. Your voice is not like his.â She felt safe in the cave."},{"09":"A little while later, someone was singing outside the cave again, âDo let me in, my sister.â âDemazane, Demazane, child of my mother, open this cave to me. The swallows can enter it. It has two holes.â The voice sounded just like her brother's, so she opened the door."},{"10":"A huge hairy man filled the opening of the cave. He grabbed Demazane before she could run away. Demazane just had time to pick up some ashes from the fire. As she was being carried away, she dropped some ashes here and there along the path."},{"11":"That day, all Demane had managed to trap was a hive full of bees. He carried them in a thick bag slung over his shoulder. When he came to the cave, he found the door open and his sister goneâ¦but ashes pointing the way into the woods. He followed the ash along the path until he saw a fire in the distance."},{"12":"Near the fire was a huge hairy man sitting with a large bag next to him. Demane walked up to the man, pretending to limp, âPlease, father, can you help me? I've hurt my leg. I need some water.â The man replied, âI'll get you some water, if you will promise not to touch my bag.â And he put the bag carefully in his hut."},{"13":"But when he had gone, Demane cut the string of the bag, and out climbed his sister. Demane replaced the bag with his own bag full of bees. Brother and sister hid and waited to see what would happen."},{"14":"When the man came with the water, his son and daughter came with him. He said to his daughter, âThere is something nice in the bag in our hut. Go! Bring it!â She opened the bag a little to see what it was, but the bees stung her hand, and she called out, âIt is biting.â âGo and help her!â he shouted to his son. But the result was the same."},{"15":"âDon't treat me like a fool,â he shouted, and stormed into the hut. He closed the door and opened the bag himself. The angry bees swarmed out and stung his head, his nose, his eyes. Blinded, he jumped about, howling with pain."},{"16":"Then he ran and fell headlong into a pond, where his head stuck fast in the mud. He turned into a piece of wood like the stump of a tree. Just right for a bee hive.

Meekly, Ma Shange reached into the pocket of her tatty old cardigan and pulled out two one rand coins. She handed them to the judge. He took them, thanking her politely."},{"17":"Then he shook the coins in his big fist, so that they made a clinking sound. âThis is my judgement,' he said to the baker. âThe punishment must fit the crime. Therefore the sound of Ma Shange's money is the payment you will get for the smells she stole. And now I wish you a good day.' The baker looked thoughtful. Then, realising how unreasonable he had been, he turned slowly and walked out of the room."},{"18":"The judge smiled kindly at Ma Shange, and handed her back her money.

Simbegwire's father did his best to take care of his daughter. Slowly, they learned to feel happy again, without Simbegwire's mother. Every morning they sat and talked about the day ahead. Every evening they made dinner together. After they washed the dishes, Simbegwire's father helped her with homework."},{"03":"One day, Simbegwire's father came home later than usual. âWhere are you my child?â he called. Simbegwire ran to her father. She stopped still when she saw that he was holding a woman's hand. \"I want you to meet someone special, my child. This is Anita,\" he said smiling."},{"04":"âHello Simbegwire, your father told me a lot about you,â said Anita. But she did not smile or take the girl's hand. Simbegwire's father was happy and excited. He talked about the three of them living together, and how good their life would be. \"My child, I hope you will accept Anita as your mother,\" he said."},{"05":"Simbegwire's life changed. She no longer had time to sit with her father in the mornings. Anita gave her so many household chores that she was too tired to do her school work in the evenings. She went straight to bed after dinner. Her only comfort was the colourful blanket her mother gave her. Simbegwire's father did not seem to notice that his daughter was unhappy."},{"06":"After a few months, Simbegwire's father told them that he would be away from home for a while. \"I have to travel for my job,\" he said. \"But I know you will look after each other.\" Simbegwire's face fell, but her father did not notice. Anita did not say anything. She was not happy either."},{"07":"Things got worse for Simbegwire. If she didn't finish her chores, or she complained, Anita hit her. And at dinner, the woman ate most of the food, leaving Simbegwire with only a few scraps. Each night Simbegwire cried herself to sleep, hugging her mother's blanket."},{"08":"One morning, Simbegwire was late getting out of bed. âYou lazy girl!â Anita shouted. She pulled Simbegwire out of bed. The precious blanket caught on a nail, and tore in two."},{"09":"Simbegwire was very upset. She decided to run away from home. She took the pieces of her mother's blanket, packed some food, and left the house. She followed the road her father had taken."},{"10":"When it came to evening, she climbed a tall tree near a stream and made a bed for herself in the branches. As she went to sleep, she sang: âMaama, maama, maama, you left me. You left me and never came back. Father doesn't love me anymore. Mother, when are you coming back? You left me.â"},{"11":"The next morning, Simbegwire sang the song again. When the women came to wash their clothes at the stream, they heard the sad song coming from the tall tree. They thought it was only the wind rustling the leaves, and carried on with their work. But one of the women listened very carefully to the song."},{"12":"This woman looked up into the tree. When she saw the girl and the pieces of colourful blanket, she cried, âSimbegwire, my brother's child!â The other women stopped washing and helped Simbegwire to climb down from the tree. Her aunt hugged the little girl and tried to comfort her."},{"13":"Simbegwire's aunt took the child to her own house. She gave Simbegwire warm food, and tucked her in bed with her mother's blanket. That night, Simbegwire cried as she went to sleep. But they were tears of relief. She knew her aunt would look after her."},{"14":"When Simbegwire's father returned home, he found her room empty. \"What happened, Anita?\" he asked with a heavy heart. The woman explained that Simbegwire had run away. \"I wanted her to respect me,\" she said. \"But perhaps I was too strict.\" Simbegwire's father left the house and went in the direction of the stream. He continued to his sister's village to find out if she has seen Simbegwire."},{"15":"Simbegwire was playing with her cousins when she saw her father from far away. She was scared he might be angry, so she ran inside the house to hide. But her father went to her and said, âSimbegwire, you have found a perfect mother for yourself. One who loves you and understands you. I am proud of you and I love you.â They agreed that Simbegwire would stay with her aunt as long as she wanted to."},{"16":"Her father visited her every day. Eventually, he came with Anita. She reached out for Simbegwire's hand. \"I'm so sorry little one, I was wrong,\" she cried. \"Will you let me try again?\" Simbegwire looked at her father and his worried face. Then she stepped forward slowly and put her arms around Anita."},{"17":"The next week, Anita invited Simbegwire, with her cousins and aunt, to the house for a meal. What a feast! Anita prepared all of Simbegwire's favourite foods, and everyone ate until they were full. Then the children played while the adults talked. Simbegwire felt happy and brave. She decided that soon, very soon, she would return home to live with her father and her stepmother."}]},{"i":"0252","t":"The tree that saved the village of Ombalantu","a":"b|Karen von Wiese,Beryl Salt,Muhdni Grimwood,Barbara Meyerowitz|Julia te Water Naude","s":[{"02":"\"Shhhu!\" says Grandmother. \"It's so hot! And this pot is so heavy. Let's sit in the shade of the tree and rest a bit.\" She wipes the sweat from her face and makes herself comfortable among the arms of the roots. Selma stands with her hand on the smooth skin of the baobab while her brother, Toivo, walks round the trunk to see how wide it is. \"This tree is very old, isn't it, Grandmother?\" \"Yes, Selma, it is. But it is not as old, or as big as the tree at the village of Ombalantu!\" \"Ombalantu? The village near here?\" asks Selma. \"Please tell us about the tree there,\" begs Toivo. \"Then sit and listen,\" says Grandmother and she begins her story."},{"03":"There was once a girl called Thaimi who lived in the village of Ombalantu. One day she went with her brother, Angula, to fetch water. While Thaimi was filling her pot Angula saw a hare. He ran after it. He ran and ran and ran - but do you think he could catch that hare? He could not. The hare was too quick for him. Thaimi's pot was full and she was ready to go home. She looked around but she could not see Angula. She did not know where he had gone. But, she did know that she couldn't go home without her little brother. So she set out to look for him. She walked and she walked and she walked. At last she found him lying in the grass behind a large anthill. As she came close he held his finger to his lips. Why did he want her to be quiet? Close by a group of strange men were resting. The men had bows and arrows...and spears! Thaimi could hear their voices. \"Angula,\" she whispered, after she had listened for a bit. \"Those men are raiders. They have come to steal our cattle and burn our village. Come quickly. We must run home and warn the village.\" So very quietly Thaimi and Angula crept away from that place. And ran towards their village."},{"04":"When they were near their village they met their uncle. He was taking his cow to the water. Thaimi called out, \"Run, uncle, run! Men are coming to steal our cattle and burn our village.\" The man shouted at his cow and made her run towards the village. Further on Thaimi saw her aunt working in the field and she called out, \"Run, aunt, run! Men are coming to steal our cattle and burn our village!\" And the woman took her hoe, picked up her sleeping baby and ran towards the village. Further on Thaimi saw her grandfather. He was limping along the road beside a donkey loaded with grain. And she called out, \"Run, Grandfather, run! Men are coming to steal our cattle and burn our village!\" Her grandfather lifted his stick and chased the donkey until it ran towards the village."},{"05":"And so Thaimi and her brother reached the village. And she called out to everyone, \"Run, run. Men are coming to steal our cattle and burn our village!\" The villagers were scared. They ran backwards and forwards like ants when a heap is trodden on by a cow. They did not know where to hide or what to do. Where could they hide their cattle? Where could they hide their grain? Where could they hide themselves? Thaimi was very frightened. Then she remembered something. She remembered the place where she and Angula sometimes went to play. A safe place. A secret place."},{"06":"\"I have a place!\" she cried. \"I know a place where we will all be safe!\" But the villagers could not hear her. They were making too much noise. How could she make the villagers listen to her? What do you think Thaimi did? She picked up a drum and began to hit it as hard as she could. \"Bam Bam Bam Boom Boom Boom.\" All the villagers stopped. Thaimi called out, \"I have a place to hide. Follow me.\" She took Angula by the arm. \"Come, we'll take everyone to our tree. We will all be safe there!\" Her brother shook his head. \"No, Thaimi. That is our secret. You said we must never tell anyone.\" \"Yes\", she said. \"It was a secret. But now we are all in danger.\" Thaimi and Angula led the way to a baobab tree which stood nearby. Nobody could understand why."},{"07":"\"Why have you brought us here? We cannot hide here,\" they said. Then Thaimi said to her father, \"Come. I'll show you.\" They climbed to the top of the tree. There was a small opening. Thaimi and her father slid down into the big trunk. It was hollow. It was huge. \"But all the people can't come in through such a small hole,\" said her father. \"No,\" said Thaimi. \"Bring axes and we will make an opening in the trunk.\" And that is what they did. They cut an opening in the side of the tree. Some villagers collected the grain and the pots. Others collected the goats, the sheep and the cattle. They all made their way through the opening into the great hollow inside the baobab tree. And the strange thing was that there was room for everyone."},{"08":"The sun went down. It grew dark and the night was quiet and cold. The raiders crept up towards the village. It was dark. \"Everyone must be asleep,\" they said. Inside the great tree the villagers waited. What was going to happen? They were cold. They were hungry. And they were afraid. Then Thaimi said, \"It's cold. Let's make a fire.\" And she took two stones and struck them together. The sparks caught the grass and small flames flared. Soon a bright warm fire was burning."},{"09":"Outside the raiders crept closer and closer. Then suddenly one of them gave a cry and pointed to the tree. Light flamed from the tree. Fiery eyes shone from the trunk. Bright tongues licked the branches. Smoke curled into the sky. \"It's a great spirit!\" they cried in fear. First one raider turned and ran. Then another, and another. Until they had all run away. The people of the village of Ombalantu were saved."},{"10":"Grandmother is silent.

He had a wife and one daughter called Nosisa. Mpunzi wanted a son, but he and his wife could not have any more children. Mpunzi blamed his wife for not giving him a son. He bullied his wife and treated her like a child."},{"03":"One day Mpunzi was very angry and he hit his wife with a stick. She ran away back to her family. She left with a sad heart because Mpunzi did not let her take Nosisa with her. Mpunzi bullied his daughter in the same way he bullied his wife. Nosisa lived a very sad life."},{"04":"Mpunzi decided to marry another wife. He hoped that the new wife would give him a baby boy. Nosisa's life became even more difficult when her father married again. Mpunzi scolded her all the time and made her serve the new wife. Nosisa worked like a slave."},{"05":"Mpunzi was very proud of his cattle. He used to sit outside his homestead and watch his cattle grazing in the field. He felt very satisfied with his wealth. Mpunzi's many servants cleaned around the homestead, and looked after his goats, cattle and sheep. They milked the cows for fresh milk that Mpunzi sold to other villagers."},{"06":""},{"07":"Mpunzi loved his new wife very much. He treated her like a queen. She sat inside her hut all day and gave orders to Nosisa and the servants. Nosisa woke up early every day to make tea for her stepmother. She cleaned her hut and cooked for her, but her stepmother always complained that her food was cold, her tea was weak, and her hut was not clean."},{"08":"One day Mpunzi became very angry at Nosisa. He scolded her and hit her with a stick. Nosisa ran off to the river where she sat and cried the whole afternoon. Suddenly she heard a voice coming out of the river. She looked up and saw a big fish. The voice was coming from the fish. Nosisa was so shocked she almost ran away, but the fish stopped her. âPlease don't run away my daughter, I am your mother. I have changed myself into a fish so that your father does not know it's me.â"},{"09":"âWhat is the matter?â asked the fish. Nosisa told the fish everything about her sad life. âDon't worry my girl. I will bring you food every day,â said the fish. The fish gave fresh vegetables to Nosisa. She had a feast. When she looked up the fish was gone. That day Nosisa went home smiling. She would not have to go to bed without food as usual."},{"10":"Nosisa went to the river every day. In the morning she woke up as usual and did her chores around the house. At midday, she went to the river. She called out every time, and every time the fish would appear with delicious food. Nosisa became happier and happier. She could talk to the fish about anything. She started to regain her health. Her skin was glowing and she was a happy child."},{"11":"Nosisa visited the fish every day until her stepmother became suspicious. Nosisa had gained weight and she was glowing. âSomething is going on at the river, I must find out what it is,â thought the stepmother. One afternoon she followed Nosisa to the river. She saw Nosisa talking to the fish, and getting delicious food. Nosisa's secret was out. âI have to do something about this fish,â said the stepmother."},{"12":"In the evening, Mpunzi came back from the fields. He found his new wife crying in her hut. âWhat is wrong my lovely wife,â asked Mpunzi. âI went to a traditional doctor,â said the wife. âHe told me that the only way for me to give you a son is to eat the biggest fish that lives in this nearby river,â she said. âWill you catch the fish for me tonight?â pleaded the woman. âI will do anything for you my beautiful wife,â said Mpunzi."},{"13":"Mpunzi set off to the river before it was too dark. He took his servants to help him find the biggest fish in that river. They searched and searched and eventually Mpunzi caught the biggest fish. He put it in a bag and went home with it. When he got to the house, there was a good hot fire ready to cook the fish. âI will make the best meal ever for us,â said the woman to Mpunzi. âYou are the bravest and strongest man I know.â Mpunzi was very pleased with himself."},{"14":"That night Mpunzi and his wife went to bed happy after their delicious meal. They left the bones on the table for Nosisa to clean in the morning. When Nosisa brought coffee into their hut in the morning they were still sleeping. âThis is very strange,â she thought to herself. âMy father usually wakes up very early in the morning to go to the fields. I wonder why he is still sleeping.â"},{"15":"âAnyway, now I can run to the river for a nice breakfast,â she thought. Nosisa ran to the river. When she got there she called out to the fish, and she called again and again. The fish never came. Nosisa started to cry. She did not know what had happened to the fish. While she was crying a bird came to sit next to her and told her what had happened. She cried harder thinking that her mother had been caught and eaten."},{"16":"The bird told her to collect the fish bones from the table and throw them back into the river. If she did that the fish would come back to life. The bird also told her to let her father and stepmother sleep and wake them up only at midday. Nosisa did as she was told. She ran back home and walked quietly into her father's hut. They were still fast asleep. She took the bones, put them inside a bag and threw them back into the river."},{"17":"Nosisa ran back home and just before midday she woke her father and stepmother. She could hardly recognise them. They looked old and grey and frail. They were too old to scold her. They were too weak to hit her. They were too tired to look after the homestead.

Everybody suffered because there was no sun. When they hunted animals to eat, they hung the meat in the trees to dry, but it rotted because there was no sun."},{"04":"One day, Dima decided to visit Owl. When they served food, Dima wondered why Owl's food tasted so good. He wondered if it was because the food grew in the sun and it was cooked in fire. Secretly, Dima made a plan. He decided to dance. He wanted everyone at Owl's place to gather around him and see him dance. He was a good dancer. Owl and his family admired the beautiful dancing."},{"05":"When it grew dark, Owl decided to fetch the sun from his house so that he could still watch Dima's dancing. Owl kept the sun in an animal skin bag inside his hut. He carried the sun out from his house and held it high up above his shoulders. Now it was light. Everyone could see far into the distance. Soon everyone was dancing in the light of the sun."},{"06":"Dima crept closer to the sun while he was dancing. Owl held on to the sun but after a while he forgot about it because he enjoyed the dancing so much. He saw how beautifully Dima danced. He too wanted to dance like this."},{"07":"Suddenly, Dima took his fighting stick and hit the sun into the air like a ball. The sun travelled so far that it remained forever in the sky. It gave everyone light all day."},{"08":"Dima ran away so fast that Owl could not find him. He stayed far away for a long time. After a while, he disguised himself and went back to Owl's place. The children recognised him and said: âThere is the man who stole our sun!â The adults did not agree with the children and said, âNo, this is not the man who stole our sun.â"},{"09":"They saw that this man was an old dancer. He wore a lot of beads around his body. They were magic dancing beads and they made people dance. It was not long before everyone was dancing. They danced the whole afternoon, until the sun began to set. It became too dark to see the magic dancer."},{"10":"Owl said to his wife, âGo and look in my bag and fetch the moon.â Owl held the moon high above his shoulders and it lit up the darkness for all to see the dance. While they were dancing, Dima moved closer and closer to the moon, for he had a plan."},{"11":"He took his fighting stick and hit the moon high up into the air. Once again, he ran away from Owl. This time he stayed away for a very long time, until Owl's family forgot all about him."},{"12":"Dima disguised himself again and returned to Owl's place. This time he wanted Owl's fire. Owl had the firesticks hanging around his neck. Dima joined Owl under a tree and the two men started playing an old clapping game called gi."},{"13":"They clapped and clapped and as they clapped some more, Owl's firesticks started jumping around his chest to the rhythm of the clapping. Clap-clap, clap-clap. Dima tried to grab the firesticks, but Owl threw them over his neck so that they hung across his back.  They clapped the whole day long. The rhythm of the clapping made Owl forget all about the firesticks. When they swung around onto his chest once more, Dima grabbed the firesticks and ran away. Owl and his family ran after Dima, but he made a clever plan. He had a bag full of thorns and threw them onto the ground behind him. This stopped Owl and his family from chasing him. They could not cross the thorns on the path."},{"14":"Dima could not wait to make fire. He rubbed and rubbed the sticks. He blew and blew the ember in a little dry grass until a tiny flame appeared. The fire grew and lit the whole veld and each time the flames reached a tree, Dima said, âFrom now on people will be able to make a fire with each tree on earth.â"},{"15":"A long time passed. When Dima finally returned to Owl's place, he found no one but a little boy playing with wooden animals. Dima asked the boy to show him where they kept their water. The boy led him to the place of water. Dima saw the big djaba, the huge clay pot in which the family stored water.  Dima pretended to leave for his home, but he secretly turned round to the place of water. He turned the huge pot over so that the water started flowing on the ground. Dima quickly jumped over the flowing water to the other side. Then he was safely across the river of water where Owl could not find him."},{"16":"This is why the whole earth has rivers full of water today. This is why we have the sun, moon and fire, because of the magician Dima."},{"17":"Story notes In 2003, Katunga Carimbwe told this version of the Dima and Owl origin story to Titu Mangumbu and Marlene Winberg in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa while he was busy painting on a canvas. Mangumbu, Mahongo and Winberg translated it and retold the story in this written version with as few alterations as possible. His elders told the story to him during his childhood in Mavinga, Angola, where he was born in 1958. Most of the episodes in the Dima and Owl myth have a wide distribution in the extensive area of southern Africa and the Kalahari whose original inhabitants speak !Xun and other closely related languages, although the names and identities of the trickster, Dima, and his adversary change from area to area. The âclapping gameâ mentioned in our version, Dima and Owl, is still current among the !xun, the Nharo, and possibly other communities of Kalahari San. This story depicts Dima as a culture hero and transformer of the primeval world into the present world.

In the heart of this forest, in the highest branches of an enormous tree, lived a very special bird â the bird that made rain."},{"03":"For as far back as the villagers could remember, they had taken the time to keep this bird happy. They saved scraps of bread, pieces of fruit and fresh coconut milk, and every week or two a group of villagers took these delicacies into the forest. When they had laid them at the base of the tree, one of them played a simple tune on the thumb piano."},{"04":"After a while, the bird flew down to the ground to eat and drink. When she had finished, she began to sing the most beautiful song. At the same time, she raised her dark, shiny blue wings, and within minutes, the rain began to fall."},{"05":"This went on for many years. Because the rain fell regularly, the crops grew abundantly and there was plenty of food in the village. But gradually things began to change. Somehow, the villagers were always busy and they began to neglect the rain bird. \"It will rain anyway,\" they said. \"It's time to stop spoiling that silly old bird!\""},{"06":"But the people were wrong. When they stopped looking after the bird, the rain stopped falling. The crops began to dry up and die, and the animals grew thin and weak. Still, nobody in the village went into the forest to feed the bird that brought the rain. Now they were all too busy trying to find money to buy food in the neighbouring town."},{"07":"One scorching day, a young girl called Ketti decided to go into the forest after school. \"At least it will be cool in there,\" she thought to herself. She walked and walked, and after some time, she came to the tall tree in which the rain bird lived. Ketti stared up at the tree. Suddenly, she remembered how her granny had taken her into the forest to feed the bird when she was still a tiny child. Ketti opened her school bag and pulled out a piece of bread left over from her lunch. Carefully she laid the bread at the base of the tree. Then, because she had no thumb piano with her, she sang an old song that she had known all her life."},{"08":"With a loud whooshing sound, a beautiful blue bird swooped out of the branches above Ketti's head and began to eat the bread. When the bird had finished, she opened her mouth and sang a few pure, high notes. Then she raised her shiny wings and all of a sudden Ketti heard the rumble of thunder. By the time she reached her home, giant rain drops were pelting down, cooling the baking red earth."},{"09":"Ketti was very happy, until she told her parents what had happened. \"Don't be silly!\" scolded her mother. \"Nobody believes that bird has anything to do with the rain anymore!\" \"Your mother is right,\" said Ketti's father. \"The drought has been broken now and we will be fine. Don't go wasting good bread feeding that greedy old bird again!\" Though Ketti didn't argue with her parents, she felt sure they were wrong. \"If only Granny were still alive,\" she said to herself, \"she would have believed me!\" But Ketti's granny had died a few years earlier. The only thing Ketti had left, was her granny's old thumb piano."},{"10":"Two weeks passed and there was no more rain. The crops began to shrivel up again and the hungry animals' ribs began to stick out even more. The sun beat down mercilessly from a glaring blue sky. \"I don't care what they say!\" thought Ketti. \"We need rain. I'm going to feed the bird again tomorrow!\""},{"11":"So, early the next morning, after taking a slice of bread and a handful of red berries from the kitchen, Ketti slipped out of the house. She began to make her way to the centre of the forest. What she didn't realise, was that her father was also awake. When he saw what his daughter was doing, he realised that she was going to feed the rain bird again."},{"12":"\"I'll teach that disobedient child a lesson!\" he said to himself angrily. He snatched his bow and arrows and silently followed Ketti into the forest. Just as the bird flew down to eat the food that Ketti had set out for it, her father raised his bow and released his deadly arrow. The arrow flew straight into the bird's heart. The bird let out a piercing shriek. Terrified, Ketti spun around â just in time to see her father fall down, stone dead. Ketti screamed and turned around â just in time to see the arrow fall harmlessly from the bird's glossy body. Then the bird, unharmed, swooped up into the highest branch of the tree."},{"13":"Ketti raced out of the forest to a scene of utter devastation. Every animal and every person she saw lay dead on the ground. With a pounding heart, she ran all the way back to her home. She quickly found her granny's old thumb piano. \"This is my only hope!\" she thought. \"The rain bird is angry. I have to make her happy again! I HAVE to!\""},{"14":"Half an hour later, Ketti was back at the base of the big tree. Her body was drenched with sweat and she was gasping for breath. A few paces away from her lay the lifeless body of her father. Ketti looked away quickly, and with trembling hands, began to play the thumb piano. She played and played, until her fingers hurt."},{"15":"Finally, what she wanted most in the world happened. Down swooped the bird as if nothing had happened. The bird ate some of the berries still lying on the ground and sang a few notes. Then, as Ketti played on, the bird raised her wings. Ketti heard a rustle behind her."},{"16":"It was her father who had woken up. \"I'm sorry!\" he said again and again to the big, blue bird. Then he held out his hand to his daughter and they walked slowly back to the village. In the village all the people and animals were alive again."},{"17":"That night the villagers held a meeting.

She gave it a good shake to get all the water out. \"If you are not going to wake up now, I'll have to put you somewhere to dry nicely,\" she said. She laid the chicken out on the grass to dry. The chicken lay completely still."},{"10":"Refiloe washed each and every one of her chickens. Each and every one of them went limp and floppy before she was finished with it.

Out fell all eight chickens. \"Eish!\" she cried jumping back in surprise. \"Oh, you are the cleanest, prettiest chickens! Just ready for my pot,\" she crooned. \"Now, where shall I hide you my darlings?\" Mme Pedi chuckled, \"I'll have to find a very good place,\" she said walking round the house. \"I know,\" she said at last, \"I'll put you on the roof!\" Mme Pedi climbed up onto the garden wall and put the chickens in a row on the thatched roof."},{"14":"The next day the sun rose in good time for the wedding.

Katitu Momambo was the youngest of the three. She was small but clever and wise. The three big girls went into the veld one day to gather food and wood. Little Katitu ran after them, but the sisters sent her back. âGo back Katitu! You are too small to go with us! Stay at home!â they said. Katitu did not pay attention to them. She followed them from a distance."},{"03":"When they noticed her, they were too far away from home to send her back, so she joined them. While she was walking behind them, Katitu cut herself some wood. She made herself a bow and many arrows. The girls walked and walked and walked until the sun dropped into the Kalahari horizon. They were lost. They walked into a deserted village and found a hut in which to spend the night."},{"04":"An old woman was sitting next to the hut. Little Katitu went and greeted her. âOh?â answered the old woman, âThis is the village of the Big Snake! He stays in a big hole in the cattle kraal. When people come to milk the cows, he eats them! He will go to your hut at night when you sleep and kill you there!â"},{"05":"Wise little Katitu did not panic. She asked the old woman for a hard cow skin to cover the door of their sleeping hut. Then Katitu wanted to sleep a little, so that she could stay awake throughout the night. âWhen the wind begins to blow,â she said to her sisters, âyou must wake me up.â The wind came up, the sisters awoke Katitu and went to sleep. Katitu fixed the hard cow skin against the door of the hut and made a little hole in the middle for her bow and arrows. Katitu heard the Big Snake approach."},{"06":"âHai, gom-gom, hai, gom-gom, where are they?â sang the Big Snake. The little clever girl answered him with a chant, âHere they are, here they are!â Then the Big Snake rushed against the hard skin at the door of the hut. Little Katitu shot an arrow through the hole in the skin. Yes, the little girl killed the Big Snake."},{"07":"Then Katitu woke up the older girls. âSister, sister, sister,â she whispered, âget up, get up, get up!â"},{"08":"And when the girls woke up they saw a big snake lying there. âCome, we have to take him back to his hole!â shouted Katitu. They rolled him up, rolled him up, rolled him up and they set him right back in his hole. âHurry! We have to run!â And the girls ran and ran and ran."},{"09":"The next morning, the Big Snake's wife told his children to go and look for him. When his children found him lying dead in his hole, they screamed: âFather is dead! Quick, let us go after those girls!â All the snake's children went after the girls. Katitu told her sisters to turn into trees. When the snakes arrived at the spot where they had seen the girls, only trees were standing there. The snakes were tired and lay under the trees to sleep. When they were asleep, the girls turned back into human beings and ran on."},{"10":"The girls continued to run and were very tired and thirsty. Eventually, they saw a waterhole! None of older sisters wanted to scoop the water from the deep well. They asked Katitu to climb in as she was the smallest. âWill you help me out of the well if I climb into it?â asked Katitu. âYes,â they replied, âwe will help you.â Katitu went into the well and scooped water for her sisters."},{"11":"Each girl drank and then walked away. They all left Katitu in the deep well and walked home. Later that evening, the elephants came to drink. One of them drank and left. Another one drank and left. The last elephant drank and swallowed Katitu with the water! A few drops of Katitu's blood sprayed onto the reeds growing at the water hole."},{"12":"Meanwhile, Katitu's sisters had arrived home without any food or wood. They were crying and told the family that Katitu was lost. Everyone started searching for her. Katitu's little brother and his friend were searching too. They became very tired and rested next to a waterhole. They cut some reeds to make themselves flutes. When Katitu's brother played on his flute, the flute sang by itself: âIs this my brother who plays me, who plays me, The other girls left me, left me and the elephant swallowed me, swallowed me!â The boy rushed home and handed the reed to his father, who played it. And again, the reed sang: âIs this my father who plays me, plays me? The other girls left me, left me, and the elephant swallowed me, swallowed me!â The father handed the reed to Katitu's mother, who played it. And again, the reed sang: âIs this my mother who plays me, plays me? The other girls left me, left me, and the elephant swallowed me, swallowed me!â"},{"13":"Katitu's father called the young men of the homestead and ordered them to find the tracks of the elephants and find Katitu. The young men hurried off. They met the first group of elephants and asked them, âElephants, elephants, have you seen the one who swallowed our girl?â And the elephants sang: â!a plaf! !a plaf! We trot lightly. We are so light, we carry nothing!â And they passed on."},{"14":"The young men met up with an old elephant in the bush and asked, âOld elephant, elephant, have you seen the one who swallowed our girl?â"},{"15":"The old elephant sang: â!a plaf! !a plaf! I trot lightly! I am so light, I carry nothing!â But now the young men heard a little voice in the belly of the elephant. âCut him open! Go on, cut him on his left side, for I am sitting on his left side!â said the voice."},{"16":"They held the old elephant down and cut open his belly. There was little Katitu lying inside! The young men took her out and carried her home. Katitu was welcomed as a hero by the villagers. And that is the tale of Katitu Mamombo. The wise little girl who saved her sisters from the Big Snake, saved them from the snake's children, and (with the help of her brother) saved herself from the belly of the elephant. Of course, her sisters were punished."},{"17":"Story notes Ju|'hoan storyteller, Nxisae Magdaline Nxao, told a short version of this story in Dkar, Botswana, in 2005 (Winberg 2009). In 1993, Sigrid Schmidt recorded another version from Paulina Oxoros in northern Namibia (Schmidt 2007: 59). This particular version was retold by Marlene Winberg in 2013 for the Cave to Cave European Union storytelling project in Spain, based on Nxao and Schmidt's recording. The âclever little girl' belongs to a well-known story type where a vulnerable young girl (or young boy), saves the lives of others, by engaging her wit and the power of words, rather than supernatural means to solve problems. The illustrations in this story are from story boards by Marlene Winberg, interpreted digitally by Satsiri Winberg through manipulations of the Manyeka Art Collection of paintings made by San artists."}]},{"i":"0015","t":"Together We're Strong","a":"b|Liesl Jobson|Alice Toich","s":[{"02":"One harsh winter, many people in the land were sick. Ma Monikazi's cheeks burned. Sweat dripped from her body. She wanted to hold the icy grass to her face to cool down. Under her blanket she held her belly and sang to the baby inside her: âBe strong, little one. Winter's not long. Be brave, little one. Together we're strong!â Her stomach growled when the baby's powerful kicks woke her at night. She ate the leftover meat in the cooking pot, hungry for life."},{"03":"One bright night the moon was bigger, fatter and pinker than ever. Her breath came fast. The baby was ready. The aunties in the birthing room rubbed her back and warmed the water. When Monikazi held her beautiful daughter in her arms, she knew she was a special girl, a fighter. What a blessing! Her name is Nontsikelelo. She will be the mother of all blessings."},{"04":"Nontsikelelo was beautiful and strong with crinkling black button eyes. She loved her older brother, Mcengi. He made her laugh and so the laughter spread. She loved to eat meat before she had teeth. Her favourite aunt always kept a little portion on the side of her plate for Ntsiki. Mcengi chased the chickens that scratched in the garden where Ma Monikazi grew spinach and squash to feed her family. Ntsiki ran after him as her legs grew strong."},{"05":"Ma Monikazi had another baby boy, Velaphi, and another, Qudalele. Finally another sister, Nomyaleko. Little Ntsiki folded napkins and washed the baby clothes. She swept the house and fed the fire. She picked up her baby brother when he cried and tickled him till he laughed. She taught them to sing: âBe strong, little one. Winter is gone. Be brave, little one. Together we're strong!â"},{"06":"Qingqiwe, her grandfather, raised horses. His favourite was Shishi, a glossy black mare. As soon as Ntsiki was old enough, he hoisted her on to the saddle in front of him. His strong arms reached around her. He laced the reins through her fingers. He taught her to talk softly to Shishi, to groom her with a hard bristled brush. When she stroked its glossy coat, Albertina whispered, âYou are the most beautiful creature. Thank you for letting me ride on your back.â"},{"07":"Her father, Bonilizwe, came home from the mines at Christmas. Ntsiki pulled herself up onto Shishi's broad back. She rode out to meet him at the bus stop. Ntsiki sat tall and straight. Her knees held firm. She handled the reins with gentle fingers. How proud Bonilizwe was of his daughter. The biggest smile Ntsiki had ever seen covered her father's face."},{"08":"On her sixth birthday she went to school. âYou must choose an English name,â said the Presbyterian teacher, but Ntsiki liked her own name. âWhy do I need a new name?â she asked. The teacher scowled and read the names aloud: âAdah, Agnes, Albertina, Anna.â What did they mean? Ntsiki liked the long name best. Al-ber-ti-na! The name had rhythm. Al-ber-ti-na! The name had bounce. Albertina was a name you didn't mess with."},{"09":"When her cousin married a handsome man from a nearby town, Albertina was chosen as an umkhapi. The maid of honour! Weeks before the wedding, she stitched her isikhakha, the short traditional skirt, and threaded bright beads onto her amatikiti. Her mother gave her the white flag and said, âYou have a big job, my blessing.â At the bend in the road Albertina waved the flag, then turned Shishi back, leading everybody from miles around to the ceremony. People would gossip if she made a mistake, but the guests lined the road. They ululated and sang. They threw down flowers for the horse and the girl."},{"10":"Her mother was often sick and needed Albertina to look after the home. In her last year of primary school, Albertina was the oldest pupil in the school. She was chosen to be the head girl and wore her badge with pride. Her best friend, Betty, told her about a competition, saying, âYou must apply, my clever friend.â âWhat is the prize?â asked Albertina, growing curious."},{"11":"âA scholarship to high school!â said Betty. âYou must apply. You'll win it, for sure.â Albertina studied until the candle burned down. She practised sums. She practised spelling. She sharpened her pencils and gave her shoes an extra shine. Next morning she passed Shishi in her paddock. The horse whinnied and stamped the ground."},{"12":"The test began. Albertina's fingers shook. The sums were tricky. Her mouth went dry. Her hand cramped on her pencil but she continued. âWell done, Albertina!â said her teacher at the end. The important official arrived and called the top two students to the stage. âWell done to Albertina for full marks,â he said, âbut you are too old. The scholarship goes toâ¦â"},{"13":"Albertina tried not to cry. âThat's unfair,â shouted Betty, hopping with fury. âThat wasn't in the rules!â How would Albertina go to high school now? She dragged her feet all the way home. The teacher wrote to the newspaper about the unfair decision. Brother Joe at the Catholic Mission station read the story over his breakfast. He cracked his boiled egg with an extra flourish. He pushed the newspaper across the table to Father Bernard. He didn't like the story one bit either."},{"14":"Soon enough there was a scholarship for Albertina. Mariazell near Matatiele was a long way from Xolobe, but the whole village erupted. Their home girl was off to high school. She would make them proud. They threw a party like no other. The women brewed the sorghum beer and lit the fires. They slaughtered chickens and stirred up pots of meat. Albertina smiled till her face ached."},{"15":"She packed her brown suitcase and polished her shoes again. Before setting off on the bus to Matatiele, she said goodbye to Shishi. Albertina brushed her coat and stroked her wiry mane. She whispered all her questions into the horse's silky ear: What if I get lost? Will I make new friends? Will I still be clever so far from home? Shishi whinnied and stamped the ground."},{"16":"School days started well before sunrise. The girls washed quickly in the cold water and swept the dormitories before Mass. The milky porridge was never quite enough; the stew not as tasty as Aunty's back home. But Albertina studied hard. She played netball on sunny afternoons. In her school holidays Albertina worked at the mission station. She rubbed and scrubbed against the zinc washboard. She boiled sheets in copper tubs, then wound them through the wringer. She hoed and tilled the school garden but missed her family. Who was telling her brothers and sisters funny stories? Who wiped their eyes when they cried? Who tickled them until they laughed?"},{"17":"Albertina loved the nuns who taught her. Could she become a holy sister? âBut nuns earn no salary,â said Father Bernard. âPerhaps you should become a nurse? You'll be paid while you study.â"},{"18":"Albertina took a train to Johannesburg. She bought a smart white uniform, new navy shoes and a shiny red fountain pen. Sick people came all day to the hospital. She cleaned their wounds with careful fingers. She held the old people gently. When the babies cried, she sang: âBe strong, little one. Winter's not long. Be brave, little one. Together we're strong!"},{"19":"Some nights Albertina worked till dawn. She looked out the window and thought of her family. Were the children hungry? Did they go to school? Who was riding Shishi? She remembered the dark green spinach. She missed the scent of the earth. There was no vegetable garden here. There was nowhere for a horse. Albertina never went to parties. She saved every shilling. On her days off she learned to play tennis. Whoosh! Plop! She whacked the ball across the net. Always, she wished for a little more money to send home."},{"20":"Walter Sisulu was a brave and clever man who dreamed of freedom for South Africa. His big smile captured Albertina's eye. They walked together down the city streets. Her delicate hand rested on his arm. Walter wanted Albertina to be the mother of his children."},{"21":"Bright ribbons decorated the Bantu Men's Social Centre on their wedding day. Albertina's long-sleeved dress had a swirling train of lace. Many friends blessed their special day. Albertina planted flowers in her little garden. Within a year, Max was born. Albertina had become a mother. One day people would call her the mother of the nation. Max had his mother's black button eyes and his father's round chin. He was the hope for their future. Albertina wanted to fight for a new South Africa, so that Max could be free. When he cried, she sang: âBe strong, little one. Winter's not long. Be brave, little one. Together we're strong!â"},{"22":"Police came in the middle of the night, banging on the door. Albertina scolded the men who messed up her house. âHow rude you are!â she said, âtrampling mud inside my home.â"},{"23":"In the morning Albertina's favourite flowers lay crushed beneath their footprints. She remembered chasing the chickens from her vegetable garden back in Xolobe and set about replanting her garden. The earth, she knew, would recover. She would support her husband who kept many secrets and hid from the police."},{"24":"She joined the women and worked to organise a march to Pretoria. The women refused to carry a pass. They sang, âWathint' abafazi; wathint' imbokodo! You strike a woman; you strike a rock!â Many hard years followed after Walter's arrest. He was jailed on Robben Island for 26 years. Albertina, also, was sent to jail many times. Often she was scared. Often she was lonely."},{"25":"But even on the darkest nights, she could see a sliver of moon through the window in her cell. She sang the song that Ma Monikazi sang before she was born: âBe strong, little one. Winter's not long. Be brave, little one. Together we're strong!â"}]}]
